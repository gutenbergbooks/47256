    <p>
      A, may I go fishing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That the boy should use the homely &ldquo;Ma,&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Mamma,&rdquo; makes it
      clear that he is not of our generation, although his generous crop of
      freckles looks familiar, and his blue jumper, coming down to the knees,
      and that battered straw hat, are sometimes duplicated in our own day. It
      is fifty years across which we look, even if he does stand out so clearly.
      The question is one that he asks daily, if not oftener, from the time when
      the pussy-willows begin to swell in the spring-time, to the season for
      comforters and woollen mittens in the late fall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hark! Do you hear the voice that is calling the boy? It comes distinctly
      across the long stretch of years, and is as sweet and compelling now as
      when it pulled at the heart of the lad on that long-ago summer day. It is
      the voice of the brook. It gurgles and laughs and pleads. It says, &ldquo;Ha!
      ha! ha! Isn&rsquo;t this a beautiful world, and this the finest day ever? Come
      on, little boy, and play in my ripples. I&rsquo;ve some nice peppermint growing
      on my banks, and all sorts of pretty pebbles that I have washed for you.
      Look sharp, now! Do you see that trout lying at the head of the riffle? Do
      you know that I counted thirty-seven as big as he is between the bridge
      and the Deer Pond? Come and catch &lsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That brook was a part, and a large one, of the first permanent impressions
      made upon the boy&rsquo;s mind. It had its rise in a little pond, concerning
      which there was the usual dark legend that it had no bottom. Just what
      held up the water was a mystery, but the boy never doubted the legend. It
      was fed by numerous springs. Vigorous and noisy from the moment when it
      broke forth from its source, the brook was ten miles of silvery laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll not go out of sight of the house you may go for an hour,&rdquo; says
      the mother, for she too has ears to hear the call of the brook and can
      understand its charm for her lad. &ldquo;Just up in the pasture-lot above the
      bridge,&rdquo; calls back the boy, and starts off with his pole and a supply of
      angleworms wrapped up in paper. Take special notice of that pole, for it
      is the joy of the boy&rsquo;s heart.
    </p>

    <p>
      He had thought that a cedar sapling, peeled and thoroughly dried, made an
      ideal outfit, until a friend gave him a straight cane-pole painted a
      brilliant blue. In after years he owned not a few jointed rods, made by
      hand of split bamboo; but the tide of joy and pride has never risen higher
      in his heart than on the day when he became the possessor of the blue
      cane-pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a place in the pasture-lot where the brook stretches itself out
      in a long reach of still water. Above and below are rippling shallows.
      Wary as is his approach, the boy sees the shy trout darting from the
      riffles into the darker water. Patiently he dangles his baited hook by the
      side of a sunken log, and trails it temptingly back and forth before the
      coverts where the cunning fish lie hidden, but all in vain. They have
      learned by experience that the presence of a blue jumper and a blue pole
      spells out danger for them, and refuse to take any risks. Is this, like so
      many other fishing trips, to end in failure? Watch the boy! Laying the
      blue pole carefully on the ground, he rolls his sleeves to his shoulders
      and, lying on his stomach on the bank of the brook, thrusts one hand very
      gently into the water. With the utmost caution he feels here and there
      under the overhanging sods until at last his fingers touch something that
      sends an electric thrill tingling through the length of his little body.
      He feels a trout, and strangely enough it does not stir. The little
      fingers gently tickle the belly of the trout as they work their way
      towards its head, and when they have encircled the body at the gills they
      suddenly contract and the fish is thrown far back upon the grass. This
      performance is repeated three or four times, and then the trophies are
      gathered up in the jumper and with blue pole over his shoulder the boy
      goes proudly homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many years after the boy had grown to manhood he was riding with a friend
      on their way to a famous trout preserve. Naturally, the conversation
      turned to fishing experiences, and he told the story of the brook and of
      catching trout with his hands. The friend looked a whole volume of
      incredulity and exclaimed, &ldquo;Well, of all the fish-lies I ever heard that
      takes the cake.&rdquo; When the clubhouse was reached the keeper, a canny
      Scotchman, was interviewed. &ldquo;Andrew, did you ever hear of catching trout
      with the hands?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it guddlin&rsquo; you mean? Mony a time. I&rsquo;ve caught plenty of &lsquo;em in the
      burns when a boy.&rdquo; The skeptic was silenced if not convinced. Since that
      time a heated discussion of this mooted question has appeared in a
      prominent sporting journal, and able arguments have been adduced to prove
      the impossibility of any such feat as that ascribed to the boy. But he
      knows, and the brook knows, and the blue pole knows; and those may doubt
      who will.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I go fishin&rsquo; down in the woods?&rdquo; The question came from an anxious
      heart, and the boy proceeded to support his request with reasons. &ldquo;The
      biggest trout are down there. Edwin Crumb caught one that weighed &lsquo;most a
      pound down there last week. There are no big ones in the pasture-lot. I&rsquo;ll
      be careful, and I&rsquo;m &lsquo;most seven now, you know.&rdquo; It was a momentous
      question. For two miles after leaving the bridge the brook ran through the
      woods, and the mother fancied all manner of possible and impossible
      dangers to her boy lurking among those trees. But then, the lad must be
      allowed to go out of her sight some time, and the day was full of
      sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you&rsquo;ll be very careful, and not go far, and be back early, you may
      go.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Whoop!&rdquo; and a small boy has disappeared from view before the permission
      is fairly spoken. No blue pole this time. The brush and alders are too
      thick and the pole too long. It is only a small birch limb, six feet long,
      possibly, that he pulls out from under the barn as he hurries to get out
      of hearing before the mother repents her rashness.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a day that was! He has not gone far before, alongside the alders in
      the swift water, almost at his feet, he captures a larger trout than any
      ever granted him by the pasture-lot. He cuts a stringer from the
      over-hanging alders, and with fish in one hand and pole in the other
      proceeds on his adventurous way. For some time he steals along the
      gravelly bed of the brook, eagerly expectant but without getting even a
      bite. Certainly this is not very exciting, and his gaze begins to wander
      to the woods. Is that crinkle-root? Investigation yields a plentiful
      supply of the peppery plant and also three or four ground-nuts. Then the
      brook pulls him back to itself and a few rods farther on he comes to a log
      across the stream and partly under water. His heart gives a thump, for
      this must be the place where Edwin Crumb caught his big trout. It exactly
      fits the oft-repeated description. He leaves the bed of the brook, fetches
      a circuit through the brush and comes out just where he can drop his hook
      by the upper side of the log in the still water. The answer to his
      invitation is prompt, but the captive is not as large as was anticipated.
      Again and yet again he returns his lure only to meet a cordial reception,
      until five fair-sized trout have been added to the alder stringer; then
      activities cease.
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot follow him all through his eventful pilgrimage, but there is one
      experience that must not go unrecorded. In a tangle of brush formed by a
      tree-top which has fallen into a deep place in the stream he spies an open
      space, possibly eighteen inches in diameter, where the water is covered
      with scum and foam. Just the place for a big trout, but there is no way of
      getting even his short pole through the brush. The line is untied, and he
      goes crawling out on a limb that hangs over the brook, and sits, at last,
      astride it and directly above the enticing spot. A fresh and exceedingly
      fat angleworm is looped upon the hook and the wriggling mass is cautiously
      dropped into the middle of the scum. It has no sooner touched the water
      than there is a sharp tug and a mighty swirl, but only the hook and the
      remainders of the worm come back in answer to his pull. Another bait, and
      again the hook is lowered into the pool. No, the old fellow was not
      pricked the first time, for here he is again and this time firmly hooked.
      To balance the body on the limb when both hands are employed in tugging on
      the line, is no easy task, but at last the trout is in his hands and
      hugged to his breast. With the fingers of one hand through his gills and
      the thumb among the sharp teeth of the fish&rsquo;s mouth, the slow journey is
      made back to the shore. Glory enough for one day! The prize measures about
      twelve inches and is thick through. Edwin Crumb&rsquo;s trout is beaten with
      room to spare.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now it dawns upon the boy that he has been gone a long time, and if he
      hopes to be permitted to repeat this trip he must hurry home. He also
      becomes acutely conscious of an awful vacuum in the region of his stomach
      which even crinkle-root and ground-nuts will not fill. He reasons with
      himself that he can reach home more quickly by striking through the woods
      to the road than by retracing his way along the brook. He is very sure
      that he knows the way, but his certitude evaporates steadily as he plunges
      his way through the woods. Just when he admits to himself that he has no
      idea in which direction the road lies, he emerges into a clearing and sees
      before him a group of farm buildings. They are certainly unfamiliar; but
      some one must live here and he can get directions as to his shortest way
      home. Who is that in the doorway? It cannot be Mrs. Woodman whose home is
      only a short half-mile from his own? But it is, and, to make his joy
      complete, this is baking-day and the good woman hands him out an apple
      turnover. All turnovers are good, but that one was far and away the best
      ever baked. A hungry boy and an apple turnover form a great combination.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not do to say that the boy and the brook were inseparable
      companions, for there were long months when the Frost King had everything
      his own way and the merry stream found it hard work to maintain its
      appearance even on the shallow riffles. Then there were swift flights down
      the hillsides for the boy, and long journeys up again dragging his sled.
      Often in the long winter nights he heard the half-smothered gurgle of the
      near-by brook, and wondered where the trout lived when the thermometer was
      below zero.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in the summer days the two friends could not be together all the
      time. A mile or so over the hill was the brown school-house to which the
      boy must make his pilgrimages five days each week for three months at a
      time, and where he learned, helped by the pictures, that three cherries
      and two cherries make five cherries, and wrestled more or less
      successfully with the multiplication table. The old meadow just above the
      orchard was a famous place for strawberries, and many hours the boy spent
      in gathering the luscious fruit while the bobolinks, perched on swaying
      mullein stalks or the old rail-fence, engaged in a vocal contest of
      riotous and maudlin song. Then a robin had built its nest on one of the
      big beams under the meetinghouse shed on the top of the hill, and the eggs
      must needs be watched and the young birds looked after. Sometimes the
      children strayed into the burial ground adjoining the church and pushed
      aside the myrtle to read on the little head-stone the name of a child that
      had died long, long ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything could make the boy forget the brook it was his dog. Very
      likely the dog had a pedigree, but it had not been recorded, and he was as
      dear to the heart of the child as if his ancestors had all been decorated
      with blue ribbons. Pedro and the lad knew where the woodchucks lived on
      the side of the hill above the pond, and it was a red-letter day when one
      of them was cut off from his hole by the two hunters and Pedro vanquished
      him in a pitched battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brook has run through the years and its laughter sounds now in the
      ears of the writer. Somehow he hopes that the River of Life will be like
      the brook, larger grown. And ever as its murmur is heard a vision of the
      mother is seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two grew into the boy&rsquo;s heart together. In the last days when that
      mother had grown weary and was waiting for rest, the son sat by her
      bedside and they talked together of the long past days, of the home under
      the hill, of friends gone on into the silence, and of the brook with its
      sun-painted trout. She has been sleeping for many years on the banks of
      the Susquehanna, lulled by the ceaseless flow of the noble river with
      whose waters the waters of the brook are mingled.

    <p>
      E may safely interpret a lowery day in haying time as a providential hint
      to go fishing. It did not require a strong hint of this kind to move
      grandfather, especially when the boy was around; for he not only loved to
      fish but he loved the boy who loved to fish, and was always planning
      something for his pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why not stop for a moment just here to consider what sort of a grandfather
      a boy should have? Of course he must have white hair and a kindly face,
      but these are comparatively unimportant parts of his outfit. It is the
      disposition that counts. He must not have nerves. The peppery, irascible,
      impatient man, who growls and sputters on the least provocation, should
      never set up in business as a grandfather. In order to highest excellence
      he should keep the boy-spirit through all the experiences of life. The man
      who has entirely ceased to be a boy is disqualified.
    </p>
    <p>
      This particular grandsire filled the bill completely. He never scolded,
      and never even grew tired of answering questions. When the little lad had
      reached the sled age, the cunning hands of his grandfather built him one
      that could easily distance all competitors. When skates had become an
      obsession, it was the same benefactor who invested his hard-earned money
      in the most wonderful pair that the boy had ever seen, and surreptitiously
      taught him to use them before the anxious mother knew anything about it.
      But the crowning day among all the many that these two spent together was
      that upon which the older boy taught the younger how to use a gun. The gun
      was a family heirloom, and tradition said that it had done duty in the
      Revolutionary War. The old flint lock had been removed and a percussion
      lock substituted; but the hammer refused to stay cocked. When it was
      fired, whatever might be the result to the object fired at, no uncertainty
      could be felt about the consequences to the firer; he was kicked
      certainly, promptly, and vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      On an historic morning in the winter, when the grandfather was going into
      the woods to chop, he took the boy&rsquo;s breath away by saying, &ldquo;If you want
      to go with me to-day and take along the old shotgun, you may, possibly,
      shoot a squirrel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Will he go? If any boy reads these lines, let him answer. Gun over
      shoulder, and heart filled with infinite happiness, the boy trudges along
      the road, through the fields, and into the woods on the hillside, pouring
      forth a steady flow of talk. When the big beech, which the grandfather is
      turning into fire-wood, is reached, a council of war is held. Directions
      are given as to the proper way of handling a gun, and especially this one.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to hold the hammer back with your thumb, and when you have
      taken good aim, let go.&rdquo; Over and over again it is impressed upon the boy
      that under no circumstances is he to point the muzzle of the gun toward
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      While instructions are going on, a harsh call sounds from among the
      distant trees. The boy does not need to be told that it is the cry of the
      grey-squirrel, and with all the speed that caution will permit he hurries
      in the direction of the hidden challenger. Every now and then he stops to
      await a renewal of the cry, and then on again. Now the call is very near,
      almost directly overhead. Evidently it comes from somewhere high up in
      that great maple. For moments that seem hours he peers here and there
      among the leafless branches. At last the flirt of a grey tail catches his
      eye, and there, stretched along a limb near the top of the trees, lies the
      quarry. Up goes the long-barrelled gun, but the muzzle refuses to hold
      still. It describes circles and rectangles and zigzags, but persistently
      avoids the squirrel. Possibly it is too heavy for the slight muscles.
      Certainly the boy&rsquo;s heart is beating a tattoo, and a severe attack of
      &ldquo;squirrel fever&rdquo; has him in its grip. Just as despair is completely
      overwhelming the lad, he sees a big log near by, and loses no time in
      getting behind it, with the gun resting upon it and pointing toward the
      tree-top. With this rest it is possible to keep the contraptious old gun
      still for a minute. Carefully he pulls back the hammer, takes a long sight
      over the barrel, and lets go. Have the heavens fallen and has the world
      come to an end? The gun bellows, and the boy turns a back-somersault in
      the snow, vaguely fancying that the entire universe has struck him. The
      squirrel is forgotten for a moment in the surprise caused by the
      back-action of the gun. But it is only for a moment, and then digging the
      snow out of his eyes, the boy peers anxiously up at the limb just occupied
      by the squirrel. It is empty. Has he missed him? Just when humiliation
      begins to creep into his heart he sees a grey heap on the snow, and sorrow
      turns to joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      With gun over his shoulder and the squirrel hidden behind him, he takes
      the back trail, and soon rejoins the chopper. &ldquo;I heard the gun go off,&rdquo;
       says the old boy. &ldquo;What did you shoot at?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A grey squirrel,&rdquo; is the answer. &ldquo;Missed him, eh?&rdquo; This is the moment of
      supreme happiness, as the concealed game is brought to the front and the
      boy cries, &ldquo;Missed him, did I? What do you think of that?&rdquo; What amazement,
      simulated or real, appears on the older face! His surprise even surpasses
      the boy&rsquo;s expectation. &ldquo;Well! Well! If that isn&rsquo;t a big one, and you
      killed him all by yourself! I&rsquo;ll take his hide off when we get home and
      you shall have him for supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It is more than probable that some dear people, if they have the patience
      to read thus far, will lay down the book in disgust, saying, &ldquo;Cruel!
      Cruel! Boys should be taught never to take life unnecessarily.&rdquo; The writer
      accepts their censure with all meekness, and assures them of his hearty
      sympathy. But he is writing of the boy in the open, the out-of-doors boy,
      the real boy, not of a becurled and anæmic male child, coddled and
      restrained and tutored until he is no more than a little manikin. And
      writing of the real boy as he has been, is, and evermore will be, it must
      be set down in all honesty that he loves the hunt.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we have wandered a long way from that lowery day when grandfather
      said, &ldquo;Boy, I can&rsquo;t work in the hay-field today; what do you say to going
      over to the river fishing?&rdquo; Now the boy had spent innumerable hours on the
      creek that flowed past the old farm-house, and had sought acquaintance
      with the bull-heads and horndace and eels for a mile in either direction,
      but the river he had fished only in his dreams. He had seen huge pickerel
      and giant perch which neighbours had exhibited as spoils from this
      wonderful stream, and in night visions he had walked along its banks and
      pulled out fish of enormous size and brilliant colouring. Now his dreams
      were to come true.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same valley with the river, and before it was reached, was the
      canal. Just below a lock, where the water looked to be infinitely deep to
      the boy, the grandfather stopped and said, &ldquo;We will try it here for a
      while.&rdquo; Nothing happened except that after feeling a tug at his line the
      boy pulled it in minus a hook. &ldquo;Probably a turtle,&rdquo; explains the elder:
      &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go on to the river.&rdquo; A quarter of a mile farther on and the shining
      river is reached, just where a dam had been many years before. Some of the
      logs remained, reaching out over the water, and upon these the two boys
      seated themselves and began to fish. Memory has failed to record all the
      incidents of that eventful day, but it has engraved the picture of the
      long string of fish which they carried home that night. The record is
      probably not any more accurate than some of which we read now-a-days, for
      it declares that this string was something over six feet long, and weighed
      at least a thousand pounds!
    </p>
    <p>
      One experience of that day will not allow itself to be forgotten. The boy
      hooked a fish that put up an exceptionally vigorous fight, but was finally
      brought in. After it had been unhooked and was being exultantly inspected
      by the younger and exhibited for the admiration of the older boy, it gave
      a sudden wriggle, slipped through the hands of its captor, and fell back
      into the river. Woe of woes! For the time, life was not worth living. The
      biggest fish he had ever caught had gotten away! In spite of the most
      heroic efforts his chin began to quiver and then came a burst of tears.
      &ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said the older boy, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll catch another just as good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That day and that particular event came back with startling distinctness
      more than thirty years later, and on the banks of the far-famed Nepigon.
      The boy had long since come to be a man, and was camped with two congenial
      friends at the lower end of &ldquo;Pine Portage.&rdquo; There had been long days of
      ideal trout-fishing and nights filled with refreshing sleep. One day an
      old man&mdash;apparently near to the Psalmist&rsquo;s limit of years&mdash;with
      his son in the prime of life, came up the river with their Indian guides
      and stopped for a few hours to try the Pine Portage pool. While the
      younger man fished from the canoe, the father stood upon a rock that
      jutted out into the river and began casting. It was not long before he
      hooked a fish which gave every indication of being a big one. The old man
      fought him well. The son stopped in his casting to look on, and the
      campers came down to the shore to watch the battle. Out of the depths the
      gallant fish flung himself clear of the water, and then all saw that he
      was of unusual size. The son hastened to the shore and offered to take the
      rod and finish the contest, but the old man refused. A half-hour passed,
      and then the tired fish began to show signs of yielding and the fisherman
      already saw himself the proud captor of a six-pound trout, when&mdash;it
      was all over. Was there a flaw in the line? Had the aged sportsman
      inadvertently dropped the tip of his rod until the fish had a
      straight-away pull upon the reel? No matter what the cause, the line had
      parted under the last surge of the fish, and he was lost. For a moment the
      old face worked strangely, and then down went the white head, face in his
      hands, and we saw the shaking body as he sobbed out his disappointment
      Then the son laid his hand upon the senior&rsquo;s shoulder and we heard him
      say, &ldquo;Never mind, father, you&rsquo;ll catch another just as good.&rdquo; Ten and
      eighty are not far apart when we go fishing.

      IDN&rsquo;T know that fish held town-meetings? That shows how your education has
      been neglected. A town-meeting is an assembly; fish assemble; therefore,
      fish hold town-meetings. Isn&rsquo;t that conclusive? But the fact is one of
      experience as well as of logical deduction. It can be &ldquo;mediated&rdquo; by the
      faith of every disciple of the immortal Izaak.

      This is the unadorned and veracious account of one of these piscatorial
      gatherings, held on an August day in Caine River, New Brunswick, seventeen
      miles from the nearest house. They had been gathering for days. Prominent
      citizens were there from Big Rock, five miles down the river, and almost
      every inhabitant of the Forks, three miles up stream, had answered to
      roll-call. A large number of youngsters who had lately taken up their
      abode in Blue Rock Brook seemed to think that this was some sort of
      circus, and had to be nipped into order by their more sedate seniors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main business on hand was to provide for the &ldquo;summer schools&rdquo; which
      had won a deserved reputation for excellence long before the University of
      Chicago opened its doors. It was customary, also, to elect a path-master
      at this time, that the highways might be looked after and kept free from
      grass. The Hon. S. Maximus Fontaine, political boss of Troutopolis, had
      things well in hand, and it was generally admitted that his slate would go
      through without a hitch.
    </p>
    <p>
      No wonder that the beauty-loving trout came from far and from near to this
      place of assembly. If the truth must be told a majority cared less about
      the election than they did for the climate. Search the country over and
      you could not find a more charming spot. Just where a great clump of white
      birches made a whispering place for the wind, Blue Rock Brook came
      gurgling down into the river. Its source was a great spring back among the
      hills, and all along its course other springs gave of their best to keep
      its waters cool and sweet. From start to finish it was uncontaminated.
      When, at last, it found the river, it rested for a little in a big, clear
      pool, before giving of its freshness to the warmer waters of the larger
      stream. Just here, with clean gravel underneath and the nodding birches
      casting their shadows overhead, enswathed in a delicious coolness that
      defied the heat of the August sun, were gathered the clans on the day of
      which we write. It was here that they were deceived, betrayed, undone by a
      stony-hearted Preacher who had journeyed far to be present at this
      meeting. But that suggests backing up and starting over again in order to
      get the Preacher to this lonely spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      How did he find the town-meeting? That is a long story and must be
      compressed if told at all. It would take more time than we have at our
      command to describe the mighty struggle through which the Preacher passed
      in wrenching himself away from the seductive stockyards&rsquo; odours of
      Chicago. He succeeded, however, and went meandering through New York State
      and Massachusetts, finally taking passage on a venerable tub that crawls&mdash;in
      fair weather&mdash;between Boston and Yarmouth. There was a vague idea
      haunting the ministerial mind that he wanted to see the Evangeline
      country; but that infant persuasion died suddenly in Digby. If any
      American tourist wants to see Nova Scotia let him keep away from Digby or
      put it last on his list. For fascination it discounts the Lorelei. All
      right-minded people (that means those who love to sail and fish) are
      charmed with this little town.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we had not set out to tell how the Preacher broke up that Blue Rock
      town-meeting, we should stop right here and relate one or two mild stories
      about the fishing at Digby. Did you ever catch pollock that were run by
      ninety-horse-power steam engines? Pollock that would strike so hard that
      they dislocated the fisherman&rsquo;s shoulders when he tried to check them up a
      bit? Did you ever catch a codfish weighing two hundred and seventy pounds?
      Now this is not about pollock or codfish, and it is just possible that one
      figure ought to be taken off the weight of that cod. Do not ask that we
      tell about the day&rsquo;s fishing on the Bay of Fundy, for we must not do it.
      We &ldquo;could a tale unfold,&rdquo; but it shall not be unfolded here lest we never
      get to that town-meeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the supper table in a Fredericton hotel that the existence of
      Blue Rock Pool first became known to the Preacher. He had opened his heart
      to the whole company and begged of them information concerning the trout
      fishing in that locality. One guest said that by driving out to the
      northeast four miles trout could be gotten in limited numbers and of small
      proportions. Another suggested going up the St. John&rsquo;s River some ten
      miles. There was much talk of what had been done in time past, and much
      regret expressed that the Preacher had not come in June or waited until
      later. The time was very unfavourable&mdash;it always is. Under such
      consolation the mercury in the ministerial thermometer sank out of sight.
      When supper was over and the Preacher was leaving the table, a small man
      who had not said a word during the entire meal took the discouraged
      dominie to one side and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are willing to make a trip of some sixty or seventy miles and camp
      out one night, I can tell you of a place where you can get some trout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the Preacher, &ldquo;I have no tent or blankets or duffle of any
      kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to all that,&rdquo; replied the little man; &ldquo;I have everything that
      you will need, and it is yours to use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      What a lot of good fellows there are in the world, and the majority of
      them love to fish. Here was a man putting his precious outfit at the
      disposal of an utter stranger, with no thought of reward or desire for it,
      simply to show a kindness to a brother devotee of the gentle art. And the
      little man proved to be a tailor. Now it has been said that it takes nine
      tailors to make a man; but you could have made nine average men out of
      that tailor and there would have been material left to patch the rest of
      the race. He gave the Preacher the name of a man who could be secured as a
      guide, helped him make out a list of eatables, brought over his caribou
      blanket, tent, dishes, etc., and bright and early the next morning the
      train going north carried a passenger bound for Blue Rock Pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Did you ever notice with what reluctance the average vehicle of
      transportation moves when it has a fisherman on board? If you use a horse,
      he&rsquo;ll go to sleep; an auto is sure to throw a fit, and a railway train
      almost invariably stops and goes backward for a good share of the time. It
      looks as if there existed some sort of a &ldquo;combine&rdquo; to prevent the
      fisherman from making connections with the place where he knows bliss is
      waiting for him. It took the train six hours to go fifty miles! They
      called it an &ldquo;accommodation&rdquo;; but by the way that fisherman growled you
      could see that he did not realize that he was being accommodated. He did
      finally get to Doaktown, where his guide lived, and found the aforesaid
      gentleman waiting for him at the station in response to a telegram sent
      the night before. His name was George&mdash;at least it ought to have been&mdash;and
      he was a clean-looking, husky fellow about thirty-five years of age. Close
      at hand was Bucephalus adjusted to a buckboard. (Bucephalus was the
      prancing steed which had consented to haul us to Caine River.) He was not
      handsome except in behaviour; in that he was a beauty. Habakkuk had
      evidently not seen Bucephalus when he wrote: &ldquo;Their horses are swifter
      than the leopard.&rdquo; The duffle was piled on behind the seat, a bag of oats
      was given the place of honour on top of the duffie, and Bucephalus, gently
      and with infinite caution, began to move. A sense of security took
      possession of the Preacher&rsquo;s soul with the first step that that horse
      took. There was something dignified and assuring about his movements that
      left the mind absolutely free to reflect upon the beauties of nature,
      untroubled by any fear of personal injury. About a mile out of Doaktown on
      the road to Caine River was a little hill. Bravely Bucephalus tackled it,
      stopping not more than twice each rod to give his passengers time to drink
      in the beauties of the scenery. It was during this period of
      hill-climbing, with its attendant spaces of quiet, that George began his
      wary approach towards getting acquainted with the Preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      George: &ldquo;Where do you live?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Preacher: &ldquo;Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George: &ldquo;What might your business be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Preacher: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a Preacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon George&rsquo;s lower jaw dropped until it almost seemed to rest upon
      the dashboard, while he rolled a skeptical eye towards his seat-mate.
      Being convinced after prolonged scrutiny that the truth had been told, he
      relapsed into silence, broken at last by the remark, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet you ain&rsquo;t a
      Baptist Preacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When his bet was promptly taken, he brought the interview to a close by
      saying, &ldquo;You must git a mighty sight more pay than our preacher or you&rsquo;d
      never got so far from home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For some time as Bucephalus jogged along through the woods George was
      evidently depressed. He may have been reflecting upon certain emphatic
      remarks addressed to Bucephalus earlier in the journey, or, possibly, he
      was wondering how he could sneak out of his job. It was evident that he
      had not reckoned on piloting a body of divinity on a fishing trip and was
      somewhat dubious as to the prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      The road ended in Caine River, and for the five miles farther to Blue Rock
      Pool there was nothing for it but to take to the bed of the stream. It
      reminded one of driving over the cobble-stone pavements of Albany, New
      York, only not quite so much so. The Swedish movement which undertakes to
      joggle you all over is not in it for efficiency with such a ride. If there
      is any part of the anatomy that is unmoved by this wiggle and joggle it
      must be in the domain of the &ldquo;subliminal self.&rdquo; When within sight of the
      destination it was found that the Preacher&rsquo;s suit-case, in which he had a
      change of underclothing, reel, flies, etc., had become discouraged and
      dropped off. It was found a mile down stream, resting against a rock, with
      not a thing wet. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll set up the tent and git supper while you go after
      &lsquo;em,&rdquo; said George, an arrangement to which the Preacher promptly agreed.
      The bamboo rod was put together, leader and flies selected, and, just as
      the sun was touching the tree-tops on the west bank of the river, the
      Preacher intruded upon the town-meeting. Hon. S. Maximus Fontaine had just
      concluded a deal by which everything was to go his way, when a strange and
      gaudy insect alighted upon the surface of the pool and went wiggling
      toward the shore. There was a wild and unseemly scramble, but the
      honourable wire-puller had his own notions of precedence and, cuffing some
      of the smaller fry out of his way and frightening off others by the glare
      of his eye, he proceeded to make that tid-bit his own. No sooner had he
      closed his jaws upon the coveted dainty than he was sorry, for there was
      evidently &ldquo;a string to it&rdquo; and that string kept steadily tugging at his
      mouth. Much as he believed in &ldquo;pulls&rdquo; he did not enjoy this one, and tried
      to part with it. He cavorted about among his astonished fellow-townsmen,
      flung himself out of the water, darted towards a well-known root that had
      succoured him once before in a like experience, but still that firm
      persuasion at work upon his mouth would not let up and, at last, he gave
      ground and was guided out into the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out in the stream, thirty or forty feet from the pool, stood the Preacher
      engineering this performance. To say that he was nervous is a mild
      statement. He was scared. It had occurred to him just after that battle
      had begun that his landing net was at the camp, and here was a big, big
      trout to be taken care of. A six-ounce bamboo rod does not lend itself to
      the derrick act by which you lift the fish out of the water by main force
      and throw him over your head, landing him some eighty rods away. It would
      not do to try tiring out the old warrior in the pool, for by the time that
      was accomplished all of his comrades would be in a state of mind that
      would effectually prevent any further levy upon them. So out in the river
      that fish must come while the fisherman takes his chances. It was a long,
      hard fight, carried on a good part of the time in swift water where the
      chances for the fish&rsquo;s escape were excellent; but at last, tired out and
      helpless, he was led into the still and shallow water near the shore.
      There, just as the fisherman was reaching down for him, the old politician
      gave a last lunge that snapped the snood, and he was free; but before he
      could gather strength to swim away the Preacher lay down on him, and the
      days of Hon. S. Maximus Fontaine were numbered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A new fly was fastened to the leader, and the disturbed citizens were
      invited to interview it. A half-dozen, so small that they did not know any
      better, were gathered in by the Preacher in one-two-three order. Then came
      a tug that meant business, and the Preacher began kicking himself for
      forgetting that landing net. It seems that a big politician from the
      Miramichi had come up to see how Hon. S. Maximus managed things, and as he
      had seen his friend tackle that first strange insect and disappear, he
      concluded that this was the proper thing to do. He followed his friend to
      the basket of the Preacher, but not until he had indulged in some
      contortions that nearly gave the sportsman nervous prostration.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the shadows had thickened and George was yelling: &ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s
      ready.&rdquo; He was mistaken. It took about fifteen minutes to dress and fry
      those half-dozen small trout&mdash;not one under half a pound&mdash;and
      while they were cooking the Preacher weighed his prizes. Hon. S. Maximus
      came within two ounces, and his friend within four ounces of four pounds.
      Did you ever take a four-pound trout, or even a three-pounder, on a light
      rod? Then you know how self-satisfied that Preacher was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tent had been pitched on a little plateau some fifteen feet above the
      river. It was nine o&rsquo;clock when supper was finished and the dishes washed,
      horse picketed and everything made ready for the night. The caribou skin
      was laid on the bed of boughs, the blankets made ready for cover, and
      George and the Preacher &ldquo;retired.&rdquo; The campfire shone out against the dark
      background of the wooded hills, the river sung a lullaby, and George told
      a story about a moose that he had killed the previous winter not more than
      forty rods from the spot where they were lying, and&mdash;when the
      Preacher waked he was freezing. The fire had gone out, it was nearly
      daybreak, and those blankets seemed made of gauze. He had no inordinate
      affection for George under normal conditions, but now he rolled over and
      clasped him to his heart. George seemed to have lost his fear of the
      Preacher, and for the remainder of the night each tried to use the other
      as a stove. Each failed of absolute success.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident that the teller of this story has violated one of the
      fundamental rules of homiletics, and made his porch too large for the
      house. There remains a whole forenoon of fishing to be disposed of and no
      time to tell about it. But if we had unlimited space at our command, who
      could fittingly describe even an hour of successful dalliance with the
      festive trout?
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no more of the size of the political boss and his friend; but
      how they came! Something over fifty trout preferred the Preacher to the
      town-meeting, and when noon came that meeting had adjourned sine die&mdash;especially
      <i>die</i>. Some were eaten for dinner, some were on the table at the
      Doaktown hotel that night, George had what he wanted, and twenty-one went
      back with the proud Preacher to Fredericton the next morning.

      TOP a minute!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the frightful jolt as one of the wheels of the wagon struck a high
      boulder and then went down to the hub in a mud-hole that called forth this
      plaintive request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get out and walk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cry came from one, but we made it unanimous with great alacrity. We
      were making our way in a lumber wagon from the railway station to Otter
      Lake. The driver said it was only ten miles to our destination, and for
      the first hour we were comparatively hilarious; then we struck the woods
      and trouble began. It was growing dark, and stumps and stones and
      sink-holes could not be seen and so were taken as they came. The wagon
      rose upon some obstruction to come down with a jar that seemed to loosen
      every joint in the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little of this was quite enough, and the party made the last part of the
      trip on foot, tripping and stumbling through the darkness until, after
      what seemed an interminable time, the lights of the cabin flashed out
      through the trees. We were in no condition to be curious as to our
      surroundings that night and, after a supper of fried trout, were glad to
      tumble into bed. The remark of one of the boys of the family that the &ldquo;old
      man&rdquo; was away, did not seem to possess much significance until later on
      when we learned that he was serving time in the county jail for shooting
      deer out of season.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sunshine of the next morning we saw our surroundings clearly for
      the first time. A little clearing of a couple of acres on the lake shore,
      a rough log cabin with a rougher barn, a beautiful little lake guarded on
      the east and south by high hills timbered to their summits,&mdash;what
      more could the seeker after rest and recreation ask? Otter Lake is too
      small to be entitled to a place on the average map of New York, but it
      lies north of the Mohawk River and east of the railway running from Utica
      to Clayton. It is not far enough east to be considered as in the
      Adirondacks, and the section is familiarly known as the &ldquo;North Woods.&rdquo; An
      alternative term is &ldquo;John Brown&rsquo;s Tract,&rdquo; as the hero of Ossawatomie at
      one time owned hundreds, if not thousands of acres of land in this
      locality, and cherished ambitious plans for a colony.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party was made up of the Doctor, the Hardware Man, Frank, Jim, the Boy
      and the Preacher. Poor Jim! He could ill afford the expense of the outing,
      but he &ldquo;felt all played out,&rdquo; as he expressed it, and the physician had
      ordered him from behind the counter to the woods. Every day he cheerfully
      assured us that he was feeling better, and every day he grew thinner and
      his breathing more difficult. He was in the beginning of a fight which was
      to go on for a couple of years longer; then he gave up the battle and lay
      down to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had come prepared to camp out, and immediate preparations were made for
      realizing this ambition. The guide proposed Independence River as a
      favourable point and, as we knew nothing of that or any other part of the
      country, we acted upon his suggestion, especially as he had told
      marvellous tales of the Independence River trout. It was not a long or
      hard tramp to the place where we struck the river and pitched the tent.
      The sun was shining, the air was soft and warm, and the Hardware Man was
      running over with enthusiasm. As we made ready for the night, with a big
      fire blazing in front of the open tent, he remarked, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve looked forward
      to this hour from my boyhood.&rdquo; Whereas the more experienced members of the
      party pulled on extra sweaters for the night, the Hardware Man proceeded
      to disrobe as if he were in his house in Harlem. When some one suggested
      that he might feel the need of this clothing before morning, he exhibited
      his sleeping bag made of blankets and assured us that this would be quite
      sufficient. Just before dawn the next morning, when the camp-fire had gone
      out and a penetrating chill was in the air, some of the party were
      awakened by the movements of the Hardware Man. He crawled out of his
      sleeping bag, arrayed himself in his discarded garments, and when asked
      what was the trouble declared, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m freezing. One night of this is more
      than enough. My ambition is satisfied.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That day was devoted to the alleged trout of Independence River. From what
      the guide had told us we had supposed that two-pounders were impatiently
      waiting to be caught. We fished all day and averaged half a trout apiece.
      Six ardent fishermen managed to capture three trout, not all of which
      would weigh two pounds. Evidently something was wrong. Fortunately,
      explanations abound when fish refuse to bite. It is too early or too late
      in the season. We haven&rsquo;t the proper bait. It is too warm or too cold.
      They were taking everything offered last week, or they will begin biting
      next week. This time the fish had left the stream and were gathered on the
      &ldquo;spring-holes,&rdquo; so the guide assures us, and we do not question his
      pronunciamento. The trouble was that we couldn&rsquo;t find any spring-holes.
      One thing the Preacher did find for which he was not looking; namely, a
      narrow escape from being shot. He had made a short cut through the
      underbrush to strike the river higher up, and as he came out upon the
      border of the stream found himself looking into the muzzle of a gun. A
      party coming down the river in a boat had heard the crashing in the woods
      and, of course, thought of deer. All that saved the Preacher was the fact
      that the man with the gun did not belong to that group of invincible
      idiots who shoot at a noise or at an unidentified moving object. A week
      later, in a camp three miles away, a young man was shot and instantly
      killed by his camp-mate who saw something moving in the bushes and fired
      on the chance of its being a deer. At the close of the day the Hardware
      Man presented numerous and cogent reasons why we should not spend another
      night in camp, and just before sundown we struck the trail back to the
      cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that we were content to make daily excursions, returning to the
      cabin at night. Camp life is delightful when proper provision has been
      made for comfort; otherwise, it is a delusion and a snare. We had not
      outfitted as we should, and our guide either did not know how to make good
      our deficiencies or was too lazy to undertake the job. There is a deal of
      poetry about tent-dwelling, and not infrequently that is all. It is
      possible to have a tent that will not leak, pitched so that a heavy rain
      will not turn your sleeping place into a pond; a bough-bed so constructed
      that the boughs do not poke you in the ribs all night; a commissary
      department that allows some little variety in the bill of fare and a cook
      who can at least boil potatoes. This, we say, is possible, and these
      desirable features are sometimes actualities. When they are, life is &ldquo;one
      grand, sweet song.&rdquo; But there are worse experiences than returning after a
      day&rsquo;s tramp, tired and hungry, to find awaiting you an easy chair, a
      well-cooked meal and a comfortable bed under the shelter of a roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      This outing was in the days before &ldquo;jacking for deer&rdquo; had become not only
      illegal but entirely unethical. The Preacher and Frank, with the guide,
      tramped one afternoon to a little lake some four miles away for the
      purpose of floating for deer that night. As it is useless to go on such a
      quest when the moon is in the sky, and that luminary had fixed upon ten
      o&rsquo;clock as the hour for retiring that night, a fire was kindled on the
      hill-side, well back from the water, and the hunters waited upon the slow
      setting of the moon. Many questions of more or less importance were
      discussed and, at last, Frank said to the Preacher,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever read &lsquo;Robert Elsmere&rsquo;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the Preacher. &ldquo;Why do you ask?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pastor &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; advised me not to read it. He
      said he had preached on the book twice, and he had never read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Preacher chuckled and then roared, until the guide growled, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
      scare all the deer out of the lake and over the mountain if you make so
      much noise.&rdquo; Possibly it was the Preacher&rsquo;s vociferous hilarity that
      explains why we &ldquo;jacked&rdquo; around the shores of the lake that night for two
      hours without sighting anything more animated than a dead stump. The
      Preacher was comparatively young then and had not learned that the less we
      know about a matter the more unrestrained and cocksure we may be in
      discussing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a few experiences are more amusing when considered in retrospect than
      at the time when they are going forward. When the guide proposed to the
      Preacher that they visit a little lake a couple of miles from the cabin,
      try for trout at sundown and then float for deer when darkness had fallen,
      the proposition was greeted with applause. Although the trail was not an
      easy one, the guide carried a canoe on his shoulders and the Preacher
      trudged on behind with the guns and rods, his mind filled with alluring
      visions of mighty trout and at least one big buck. When the lake was
      reached and it came time to joint the rods, it was discovered that the
      reels and lines had been forgotten. The fly-book, with its gaudy contents,
      was in the Preacher&rsquo;s pocket, but neither of the two felt competent to do
      any successful fishing without a line. It would be dark before the trip to
      camp and back could be made and, reluctantly, the fishing part of the trip
      was abandoned. That night there was no moon to compel them to wait upon
      its slow movements, and as soon as darkness had fallen the &ldquo;jack&rdquo; was
      lighted and the slow circling of the lake began. About two-thirds of the
      way around, the guide stopped paddling, then gave the canoe a little twist
      so that the bow pointed towards shore, and the Preacher felt the slight
      shaking of the canoe agreed upon as the signal to shoot. Shoot at what? He
      could see nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A whisper came from the guide&mdash;&ldquo;Shoot!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; was wafted back from the half-paralyzed lips of the Preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There at the edge of the lily-pads, just a little to your left.&rdquo; Did the
      Preacher see the dim outline of a form? He does not know to this day, but
      he shot as he was commanded. A mighty snort answered the shot, then
      splashing of water and breaking of limbs, and the guide announced, &ldquo;You
      missed him.&rdquo; The assertion was entirely gratuitous. In fact, the Preacher
      had not expected to hit what he could not see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just about that time a thunder-cloud in the west became so threatening
      that the guide proposed that they go on shore and get under shelter. That
      sounded good, but it was not just clear to the passenger where the shelter
      was to be found. However, the mystery was solved when the guide pulled the
      canoe to a dry spot on shore, turned it upside down, and both crept under
      it as the first big drops of rain came pelting down. Just as the Preacher
      was congratulating himself upon their good fortune, the dulcet note of a
      mosquito sounded in his ears. He promptly slapped, and then kept on
      slapping. The singer was the advance guard of an innumerable host. All of
      the tribe between Paul Smith&rsquo;s and Lowville had evidently gathered to the
      feast. To make a bad matter the worst possible, the quarters were
      exceedingly cramped. One could not well roll over without rolling from
      under the canoe. The omnipresent root was persistently punching the
      Preacher&rsquo;s ribs. To lift his sufferings to the nth power, that guide went
      to sleep and actually snored. It would have been a satisfaction to have
      companionship in suffering, but now this was denied him. Was it only four
      hours? It seemed like four eternities before the guide decided that they
      ought to start for the cabin. The storm had passed, but every bush
      showered quarts of water at the slightest touch. Just where the advantage
      lies in keeping dry from the storm, only to get soaked to the skin from
      tramping through miles of wet underbrush, is not yet quite clear. At two
      o&rsquo;clock in the morning the cabin was reached, <i>sans</i> trout, <i>sans</i>
      deer, but not <i>sans</i> mosquito bites or a thorough drenching.
    </p>
    <p>
      What a day that was which the Doctor and the Preacher spent on the East
      Fork! The lake is fed by two streams, one flowing in from the southeast
      and the other from the southwest. By a trail the eastern branch could be
      struck well up towards its source, and from this point down to the lake
      furnished just about the right distance for a day&rsquo;s fishing. Bright and
      early the start was made, with plenty of bread and butter, a skillet, and
      a supply of fat, salt pork. The fisherman who could not be happy on such a
      stream, on such a day, whether the fish would bite or not, listening to
      the laughter of the water, watching the flickers of sunshine strained
      through the meshes of the trees, drinking in the sweet, pure air, in close
      touch with nature, is a hopeless pessimist. Fishing side by side,
      sometimes one and then the other going first, the friends loitered down
      that beautiful stream while &ldquo;not a wave of trouble rolled across their
      peaceful breasts.&rdquo; Now and then an exceptionally fine trout was taken, and
      then fishing was suspended while they examined and exclaimed over it. They
      wondered again, as they had often done before, why some of the fish should
      be red of fin and belly and with yellow meat, while others had the
      greyish-white fin and belly, with white meat. The Preacher caught two
      trout from under the same log, one with blood-red fins and golden flesh,
      the other white. They were both speckled trout, lived side by side, ate
      the same food, but differed as greatly as a red-headed boy and an albino.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon, where the waters of a cold spring bubbled out of the bank, a fire
      was made, the fat pork set to sizzling in the skillet and then&mdash;but
      what&rsquo;s the use? Trout fresh from the brook, fried over a fire in the open
      and eaten with an appetite engendered by hours of tramping and wading,
      make a dish for the adequate description of which words are impotent. Of
      course, the smaller trout were chosen for the mid-day meal, not alone that
      the catch might look better when exhibited that night, but because they
      tasted better than the larger ones. How many did we eat? Ask the Doctor!
      Who should understand the proper amount of food to be taken into the
      stomach at a single meal, if not one of his profession?
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour or so for luncheon and chatting, and then into the stream again
      and on our way towards its mouth. The creels were getting heavy, and the
      Doctor decided to take a short cut for the lake shore. Just before
      starting, the two were standing near together fishing a pool, when the
      Doctor, taking a forward step, slipped on a smooth stone and began
      falling. The process was the most slow, deliberate, and altogether comical
      the Preacher ever witnessed. As he began losing his balance and tipping
      over backwards, he made frantic efforts to regain his poise. Both hands
      waving in the air, one clutching his rod, eyes popping out of his head, a
      look of mingled surprise and disgust illuminating his manly face, the
      final, mighty splash as the stream yielded to the impact of his body,
      formed a most delightful picture for his sympathetic and sorrowing
      comrade. Strangely enough, the Doctor could not see the humour of the
      situation, and if he should ever deign to read this truthful record it is
      doubtful if he cracks a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoroughly drenched, the Doctor&rsquo;s previous determination to take a
      short-cut home was much strengthened. He struck off into the woods and the
      Preacher was left alone to follow the stream. When he had reached the
      cabin the Doctor had not arrived. When it was almost sundown and no
      Doctor, the guide started out in search of him. According to later reports
      the Doctor was found in a depressed state of mind playing hide-and-go-seek
      with the trees in a tamarack swamp. The guide declared that he knew where
      they were all of the time&mdash;a most credible statement. They were in a
      tamarack swamp. It was well towards nine o&rsquo;clock when they arrived at
      camp, and it took a hot supper to restore their normal good spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guide had frequently descanted upon the excellence of the fishing on
      &ldquo;Lost Creek&rdquo;; but as that stream was seven miles away, and no trail led to
      it, members of the party had not shown great eagerness to make the trip.
      But when the lake and near-by streams had become familiar through frequent
      visits, the Doctor, the Boy and the Preacher decided upon an excursion to
      &ldquo;Lost Creek.&rdquo; After crossing the lake, the guide plunged into what seemed
      an impenetrable jungle, and steadily led the way up and over the hill,
      through dense thickets showing no sign of ever having been traversed
      before. He never seemed to hesitate which way to go, and his confidence
      was inexplicable to those who followed until he pointed to a tree that had
      been &ldquo;blazed,&rdquo; then to another in the distance. He was not guessing or
      travelling by compass, but following a &ldquo;blazed trail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first sight of the stream was disappointing not to say disheartening.
      Here was no dashing brook dancing its way along, but seemingly dead water
      in a great stretch of marsh land. The guide called it a &ldquo;beaver-meadow,&rdquo;
       although we saw no signs of the animal or of its architectural activities.
      But there were trout, as we soon proved. Pushing along through the marsh
      grass, frequent catches of good-sized fish were made, until at last the
      Preacher had a notable experience, not only for that day, but for any he
      ever spent in fishing. The Doctor was fishing ahead, and as he vacated a
      dry hummock, having taken two trout from that point of vantage, his friend
      stepped into the same spot. The first cast brought a trout, as did the
      second and the third and so on until he had taken sixty fine fish without
      stirring from his tracks. And they all came from the same point in the
      stream. The lure fell in vain three feet away from this particular spot.
      They were not fingerlings, but ten-inch and twelve-inch fellows. The
      Preacher&rsquo;s creel and his pockets were full when the guide and the Doctor,
      returning along the creek, came upon him. The guide&rsquo;s explanation was that
      the fortunate Preacher happened in his first cast to strike a &ldquo;pot-hole,&rdquo;
       a depression in the bed of the creek, where the water was cool and in
      which the trout gathered in great numbers. The explanation mattered little
      to the Preacher; it was the fact that counted. Even now he would gladly
      give two old sermons to be permitted to stand again on the banks of &ldquo;Lost
      Creek&rdquo; if he were sure of locating that &ldquo;pot-hole.&rdquo;

    <p>
      E agreed, my wife and I, that the couple whom we saw for the first time in
      the post-office at Domo d&rsquo;Ossoli and a little later met in the gathering
      room at the hotel, would be well worth knowing. They were, evidently, not
      only husband and wife, but good chums, thoroughly congenial, and rejoicing
      in each other&rsquo;s companionship. That they were intelligent no one could
      doubt, and they radiated kindliness and courtesy. They were dressed for
      roughing it, and we were prepared for the remark of the gentleman, made to
      a by-stander, that they had been spending a week in mountain climbing in
      the neighbourhood. When he added that they would cross into the Rhone
      Valley by diligence on the morrow, we were conscious of a distinctly
      pleasant sensation at the thought that, for one day at least, they were to
      be our fellow-travellers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The table d&rsquo;hôte that evening gave us the desired opportunity to cultivate
      the acquaintance of the attractive strangers, for they were seated
      directly across the table from us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going over the Simplon tomorrow?&rdquo; I venture to ask the gentleman. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;&mdash;Dead
      pause! &ldquo;I am sure that you enjoy Italy,&rdquo; is our next effort to make
      conversation. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; a pause even more absolutely dead than the preceding
      one. What&rsquo;s the matter? Do they take us for pickpockets? We furtively
      examine our attire to see if we are looking especially dowdy, but can
      discover nothing very reprehensible. Possibly they are diffident, so here
      goes for another attempt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know at what time we start in the morning?&rdquo; Of course we know,
      have known for weeks; but it is a question whose answer offers good-sized
      opportunities for something more than a monosyllable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six-thirty.&rdquo; We wait anxiously, but that is all. Even the most obtuse
      individual must come to the conclusion that the questioner is being
      snubbed; quite courteously, but also very unmistakably snubbed. Our
      American blood begins to boil gently, and a solemn vow is registered then
      and there to let these attractive but unfriendly people severely alone.
      Meanwhile, they have been chatting with each other in some unfamiliar
      language which is not Italian or French or German.
    </p>
    <p>
      When we leave the hotel the next morning for the all-day ride over the
      Alps our unresponsive fellow-travellers are in the banquette at the
      extreme rear end of the diligence, while we occupy the coupé directly
      under the driver&rsquo;s seat. We could not speak to them if we would, and would
      not if we could. Indeed, they are soon forgotten in the joy of the hour.
      The deep blue of the Italian sky unflecked by a cloud, the broad, smooth
      highway, the cottages with their tiny patches of cultivated land, the
      exhilarating morning air and the rattling pace at which we bowl along for
      the first mile or more, would help us to ignore even a greater unhappiness
      than that caused by the snubbing of the previous evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we have left the level road and begin the long and tortuous climb
      towards the summit of the Simplon Pass. Again and again we cross the
      brawling stream with which the road disputes the right of way. The bridges
      are all of solid stone. Yonder, to the left, the mountains rise in great
      ridges and piles of raw rock, while on the right a more gentle slope is
      covered with grass and shrubs. We begin to count the waterfalls, threads
      of spun silver hung against the dark background of the rocks, but soon
      lose track of the count. On the heights the snow is lying, and by the
      roadside the wild flowers blossom in profusion. What a glory of flowers we
      find on these Alpine heights! In every meadow and pasture lot red and
      yellow and blue and purple, with many indescribable shades, delight the
      eye and the heart of the traveller. The rhododendron, with its brilliant
      colouring, is everywhere, and the little forget-me-not nods to every
      passerby. Up and still up we climb, and every turn of the road brings new
      exclamations of delight as the wonderful panorama of mountain and valley
      unfolds before us.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now we have reached the summit, and the tired horses are brought to a
      halt in front of the little hotel where we are to have our mid-day meal.
      The village is a tiny one, of a dozen houses or so. The hotel does not
      look especially attractive, and the meal is even less appetizing than the
      appearance of the building has led us to expect. For once in our life we
      refuse chicken&mdash;at least we are content with one mouthful. Without
      attempting to file a bill of particulars, it is enough to say that the
      interval between the death of that bird and its appearance on the table as
      food has been unduly prolonged. With absolute unanimity the guests abjure
      chicken, for that meal at least. The food is so sublimely bad that every
      one laughs, and even our foreign friends who refused to respond to our
      advances of the previous evening join in the merriment. Somehow, during
      the course of the meal, we are led to speak of our nationality, and then
      comes the revelation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Americans?&rdquo; cries the hitherto unfriendly foreigner. &ldquo;Americans?&rdquo; echoes
      his wife, who up to this time had not been supposed to understand a word
      of English. The mystery is solved. This gentleman and his wife are
      Hollanders and have taken us for English. It is at the time when the
      English-Boer war is at its height, and the Hollander has no dealings with
      the Englishman if he can help it. The gentleman is an Amsterdam physician,
      and a man of culture and wide reading. His evident effort to be friendly
      reaches a climax when he tells us of his hotel at Brieg, where we are to
      spend the night, and assures us that there we will be certain to have
      trout for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now for the last half of the trip! We have only just left the hotel when
      the diligence is stopped and the passengers are asked to get out and walk
      for a mile across the debris of an avalanche which came thundering down
      from the terminal moraines of the Ross Boden glacier the previous spring.
      The diligence sways and lurches and thumps along, while we pick our way
      over stones and ice and around giant rocks. Halfway across we meet a young
      man who has spent nearly all of his waking hours for months past in search
      for the body of his sister who met her death under the sudden sweep of the
      avalanche.

      Here, in this little monastery&mdash;so they tell us&mdash;is where
      Napoleon made his headquarters for a time when he led his troops over the
      mighty mountains to the sunny plains of Italy. We stop long enough to
      admire the St. Bernard dogs, and then on down the mountains. When we begin
      the descent some of the party assert that this ride will be less
      interesting than that of the morning when we were all the time climbing
      upward. Possibly it is; but it is far more exciting. Five horses going at
      full speed towards a precipice which drops away for a full thousand feet,
      the leaders seemingly pawing into space before they turn the corner, the
      outer wheels of the diligence constantly flirting with the edge of the
      precipice&mdash;these are things that lead to nervous prostration. As I
      look back at that trip I am satisfied that it was only by leaning hard
      toward the inside of the road that I saved the passengers and the whole
      outfit from untimely destruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Amsterdam doctor descanted upon the deliciousness of the trout
      served in the Brieg hostelry, he awakened memories of the Nepigon and the
      Adirondacks, of northern Wisconsin and the Miramichi! I formed a
      resolution, then and there, to catch as well as to eat some of the trout
      for which Brieg was said to be famous. Arriving at Brieg at 5.30 p.m.
      after our drive of forty miles, I at once interviewed the concierge of the
      hotel, who assured me that it would be no trick at all to catch a mess of
      trout before dinner-time. Away to a tackle store, where line and leader
      and hooks were bought and a cane-pole rented, an interview with the hotel
      &ldquo;boy,&rdquo; who dug a can of worms fat enough to have come from Holland, and
      then for the Rhone, which was rushing along the valley about half a mile
      distant. The first sight of the river somewhat dampened my ardour. It was
      of a dirty milk colour, and no respectable American trout would live in it
      for a moment. But then, I reasoned, Swiss trout may not know any better&mdash;so
      here goes. I fished in the rapids and in swirling pools, under low bending
      alders and by the side of huge rocks. I skittered those fat worms on the
      surface, and dropped them down to the bottom. Every trick of the angler
      learned by experience or gathered from conversation and reading, was tried
      in vain. Tell it not in Skegemog and publish it not on Prairie River!&mdash;but
      I never had a bite. And yet I was not cast down. The setting sun was
      turning the mountain tops into glory, the laughter of reapers in a
      neighbouring field, the tinkle of goats&rsquo; bells far up the mountain side,
      the gurgle and singing of the Rhone, the beauty of that matchless valley&mdash;I
      had gained all these by my efforts, even though of fish I had none.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let no hard-hearted reader giggle over my poor luck, for when I sat down
      that night to dinner, and the far-famed Brieg trout were placed before me,
      behold! they were not trout at all, but some sort of a sucker, full of
      pronged bones and with soft white meat. I never had any ambition to catch
      suckers.

      R. W. D. HOWELLS made a most pathetic confession some years ago in an
      article contributed to a well-known journal when he said concerning
      vacations, &ldquo;Whatever choice you make, you are pretty sure to regret it.&rdquo;
       Either Mr. Howells was &ldquo;out of tune with the universe&rdquo; or he never tried
      Edgartown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lest some of our readers should assume some selfish motive as prompting
      this bold proclamation of Edgartown as an attractive spot in which to
      spend the summer days, let it be said that the writer does not stand in
      with any hotel proprietor or real estate dealer in this village by the sea&mdash;or
      elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just how Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard came by its name is not certain. One tradition
      has it that when, in 1605, Bartholomew Gosnold sailed from England for
      &ldquo;Northern Virginia&rdquo; and chanced upon No Man&rsquo;s Land, he gave it the name of
      Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard, and that, for some unknown reason, this name was
      transferred to the neighbouring island.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still another tradition alleges that the first settler on the island had a
      loved daughter to whom he gave a tract of land where vines grew
      luxuriantly; and so not only her tract, but the whole island came to be
      known as Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard. Neither theory costs anything; they are
      probably about equally true&mdash;you can take your choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the extreme eastern end of Martha&rsquo;s Vineyard is the quaint, restful
      village of Edgartown. Turn your face towards the sun-rise and you look
      across a narrow bay to Chappaquiddick Island, lying like a giant earthwork
      to protect the village from the assaults of the ocean. Wouldn&rsquo;t you like
      to ramble about a bit? We&rsquo;ll start in at this ravine south of the town,
      for it was here that the first settler made his home. Considering that he
      built his log cabin in 1630, only ten years after the landing of the
      Pilgrims, it is not strange that nothing remains to mark the place of his
      abode but this grass-grown depression in the hill-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going south along the main street we come to the old Mayhew house, built
      in 1698, and looking as if it proposed to stand for a few centuries
      longer. Tradition has it that during the Revolutionary War a cannon-ball
      passed through its walls, going in at the rear and coming out at the
      front. We stop just long enough to make an unsuccessful hunt for the hole,
      and then on to the Collins place. What is there especially interesting
      about this fairly modern house? Just this: that it was our home through
      many summer days, and we can never think of it or of its hospitable
      mistress without a thrill of delight. Out there in the front yard gleam
      the white grave-stones which mark the resting places of members of the
      family who died a hundred and fifty years ago. From the wide porch at the
      back of the house you look out over the bay to Chappaquiddick, and may
      even catch glimpses of the sea, looking either to the north or to the
      south.
    </p>
    <p>
      We&rsquo;ve rested long enough, and will resume our journey up the street to the
      Fisher house. Some day we will make a long stop here, for it is a
      pre-revolutionary mansion and full of relics of the olden days. Here are
      quaint old deeds, some of them in the Indian language, and no end of
      curios gathered by members of the family during a prolonged stay in Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you&rsquo;ve leisure, let&rsquo;s visit the piers. Time was when all was bustle
      here, but it is depressingly quiet now. Forty vessels in a single year
      sailed from this port in search of whales. An old record bearing date of
      November 11, 1652, tells us that &ldquo;Thos. Daggett and Wm. Weeks are
      appointed whale cutters for this year; voted the day above written.&rdquo; In
      those days whales were frequently cast upon the beach by severe storms,
      and whale cutters were appointed to insure a fair division of the spoil.
      Now the whaling industry is a thing of the past. One of the pathetic
      sights of the village is an old whaling vessel tied to the pier and slowly
      rotting away. It is many a year since the last of these vessels sailed
      from port, but if we are fortunate enough to meet one of the retired
      captains and can induce him to tell us something of his experiences, we
      shall come quite near enough to the hardships and privations of those
      heroic days. Do you see that man going along Water Street? He sailed a
      whaling vessel for forty years, and one of his voyages lasted six years
      lacking ten days.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can take your choice between visiting the old burial ground on &ldquo;Tower
      Hill&rdquo; or going out for a sail. Take the sail? I thought so. Of course,
      there are brown old head-stones with quaint epitaphs up there on the hill,
      but who that is in possession of his senses would pass up the chance to go
      sailing in a Cape Cod catboat on such a day as this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we are on board the &ldquo;Quickstep,&rdquo; one of the smartest boats on the
      coast, with a captain who knows the sea as a native New Yorker knows
      Broadway. While we are dropping down the bay before the light wind, you
      may like to hear of the gale when this same boat and captain were blown
      out to sea. The storm came up suddenly and the wind blew directly off
      shore. The captain was fishing just off the Muskeget shoals and tried hard
      to beat in, but in vain. When the gale had blown itself out, wrecks were
      strewn all along the coast, and the Edgartown people had given up the
      captain for lost; but on the fourth day he came sailing into harbour.
      Single-handed and alone he had fought the storm and had won the fight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Isn&rsquo;t this a great day? and isn&rsquo;t this the ideal way of getting over the
      water? Better let the captain take the tiller, for we&rsquo;re coming to the bar
      and the channel is crooked. Now we&rsquo;re over and you can see Nantucket off
      there to the south. Where you see the rough water is Muskeget shoals, and
      the captain says that at certain tides the strongest vessel would be
      wrenched to pieces by the fierce currents and counter-currents. Did you
      ever see sky more blue or feel air more full of tonic? Don&rsquo;t worry! We
      shall curtsy a little, but the water is not rough enough to make trouble
      for the most sensitive landsman. Going around Chappaquiddick, Captain?
      Good! That is just about a twenty-mile sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have I ever been out here when it was rough? Haven&rsquo;t I told you about the
      trip after mackerel when we had on board a load of theology? No? Well, we
      shall have plenty of time for the story before we sight the light-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a nasty sort of a morning, but as friends had come over from
      Cottage City the night before for the express purpose of having a day with
      the mackerel we concluded to try it notwithstanding the weather. Dr. G.
      had brought along his boy of twelve, and as we sailed down the quiet water
      of the bay that boy was simply bubbling over with happiness. The lad
      besought his father to make an arrangement with the captain whereby he
      should spend at least a month on this boat the following summer. The
      captain seemed willing, and as we crossed the bar the boy was exulting in
      the assurance of long days of perfect bliss only one year ahead. The wind
      was blowing fresh from the north-west and as soon as we were out from
      under the shelter of the land the boat began to curvet and jump and roll
      and quick-step just as any respectable boat is bound to do under such
      circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      In less time than it takes to write this down the joy of life had departed
      for that lad and he was carefully laid away. The lone layman of the party
      was a close second, and, losing all interest in mackerel, he stretched
      himself out on deck. The Professor followed suit, and Dr. G., after a
      heroic struggle, proceeded to part company not only with one breakfast,
      but, seemingly, with a dozen or more. The captain, who was an interested
      spectator of the process, murmured to the writer, &ldquo;Holy mackerel! What an
      eater that man must be.&rdquo; All day we rolled and pitched, with three of the
      party groaning to be put on shore. We caught only a few mackerel, but we
      had a great deal of exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
      How do we catch mackerel? As you are asking how we do it, and not how it
      is done by the heartless, unimaginative, commercialized Philistines who
      chase the schools in steam vessels, I&rsquo;ll tell you. The night before, the
      captain gets the fodder ready. I mean the fodder for the mackerel, not for
      the fishermen. It is about as nauseous a mess as one can imagine. Salted
      menhaden and the refuse from scallops are ground up together, forming a
      mass of about the consistency of thick molasses. There is the grinder now,
      just inside the cabin! Looks like a big coffee-mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      We usually start early in the morning, sometimes before daylight, in order
      to take advantage of a favourable tide. When we are out to sea a sharp
      lookout is kept for that peculiar ripple on the surface of the water which
      denotes the presence of a school of mackerel. When we have sailed to the
      spot we &ldquo;come-to&rdquo; and drift with the tide, while dipperful after dipperful
      of the &ldquo;chum&rdquo;&mdash;as the sticky and malodorous mess is called&mdash;is
      thrown out upon the water. The mackerel will throng about the boat to feed
      upon this dainty, and then the fishing begins. Empty barrels on deck, a
      line&mdash;some fifteen feet long&mdash;in each hand, with hooks that are
      set into pieces of lead forming a &ldquo;squid,&rdquo; and the sport begins. It is
      usual to bait with a piece of mackerel belly, pure white; but very often
      the greedy fish will bite at the shining lead. You do not stop to unhook
      the fish, but simply slap them over into the barrel behind you, and then
      out with the hook again. Sport? Yes, of a sort. Gets a little monotonous
      after a while. The captain fishes for the Boston market, so we have no
      twinges of conscience about catching as many as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do we catch anything besides mackerel? If you&rsquo;ll put out that line and the
      captain will sail along the edge of one of these &ldquo;rips&rdquo; you are very
      likely to have a practical answer to your question. Nothing that time; but
      the captain is coming about and we&rsquo;ll see what happens on the other tack.
      This is the poetry of sea-fishing. Here we are bowling along with a full
      sheet and&mdash;hang on to him! No, you have not hooked on to a railroad
      train but a blue-fish. Look out! Don&rsquo;t slacken on your line or you&rsquo;ll lose
      him. Hurts your fingers? Of course it does. You should have put cots on
      them. Give him a swing! Keep him clear of the boat! There!
    </p>
    <p>
      There&rsquo;s your answer. He&rsquo;s the bravest, pluckiest, gamiest fish on the
      coast. We sometimes spend a half day or so fishing for bottom-fish like
      scup, black-fish, or even flounders, for they bite freely and bring a fair
      price in the market; but if you&rsquo;re fishing for sport, there is just one
      fish in these waters which fills the bill completely, and that is the
      blue-fish. Sometimes you fish for hours without getting a strike, and then
      all at once you run into a school of them. When this happens you have your
      work cut out for you. I remember a day at Block Island when the Doctor and
      I had sailed almost entirely around the island with our lines trailing
      unmolested behind the boat. Just as we were approaching the starting place
      the captain said, &ldquo;Look at the bluebills jumping, over towards shore!&rdquo; The
      bluebill is a small fish some four or five inches long, and favourite food
      for the blue-fish. We tacked and sailed across the school, back and forth,
      again and again, and when the fray was over we had sixty blue-fish lying
      in the bottom of the boat that averaged over five pounds in weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      There&rsquo;s the light-house; we&rsquo;ll soon be in. See that hotel on the hill?
      I&rsquo;ve just time to tell you of something that happened there on a summer
      morning a few years ago. I met Dr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; on the
      Providence boat and he asked where we were stopping and if we had any
      fishing. When I told him of the &ldquo;Quickstep&rdquo; and Captain Frank and the
      mackerel, he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be over Monday morning. I&rsquo;m tired of Assemblies
      and Chautauquas and hotel piazzas.&rdquo; Monday found him with us, and
      arrangements were made to start at five o&rsquo;clock Tuesday morning. The hour
      came, but Dr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; did not. The captain worried
      about the tide and the bar, and I volunteered to see what had become of
      our tardy friend. Pounding on the hotel door I finally managed to rout out
      the night watchman, who readily went in quest of the Doctor. Upon his
      return he reported that the would-be fisherman had been asleep, but was
      now dressing and would be down very soon. The minutes passed, the tide was
      ebbing, and no Doctor. Finally I suggested to the watchman that he make
      another trip to see if he could not accelerate the Doctor&rsquo;s motions.
      Reappearing after a little, the watchman said, &ldquo;What do you think? That
      miserable old cuss had gone sound asleep again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fall was there, my countrymen!&rdquo; The D. D., the LL. D., the
      eloquent preacher, the famous lecturer, the renowned defender of the
      &ldquo;faith once delivered to the saints,&rdquo; the man whose name is a household
      word among those affiliated with one of our largest Protestant bodies
      catalogued as a &ldquo;miserable old cuss!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here we are, at the pier. Confess now, that for unadulterated pleasure a
      sail such as we&rsquo;ve just had beats motoring, whether on land or water, out
      of sight. Independent of the wind in a motor boat? Yes, but not of the
      sputtering and chugging and smell. Remember what Tennyson says in Locksley
      Hall? I don&rsquo;t know that I can quote it accurately, but the idea is that a
      day in a cat-boat is better than a thousand years in a naphtha launch.

      E reached the lake in the evening-, and started out bright and early the
      next morning to call upon some of the old inhabitants who wear fins and
      have a reputation for being scaly. A new and fascinating Dowagiac minnow
      caught the eye of a big bass before we had gone forty rods, and
      connections were promptly established. As he was being kindly but firmly
      persuaded to approach the boat he flung himself into the air, gave a twist
      and a wiggle and a shake and thus succeeded in appropriating that Dowagiac
      to his own uses. He has not been heard from since that brief interview,
      but it is safe to say that he is putting on airs as he dangles that
      rainbow-coloured minnow before the eyes of his admiring relatives. We have
      sometimes doubted the truth of the old saw that it is unlucky to lose the
      first fish hooked, but all doubt on that point has been put to flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      A day or two later five fine bass were caught one afternoon and hung over
      the side of the boat on a hastily improvised stringer. Rowing home the
      stringer parted through chafing on the side of the boat and the bass went
      their respective ways. Not content with this unfriendly slap, Dame Fortune&mdash;or
      inexcusable carelessness&mdash;permitted the string of the minnow pail,
      also hanging over the side of the boat, to break, involving the loss not
      only of the pail but of some four dozen A-1 minnows. When the Junior had
      captured a three-pound bass we concluded to tie him&mdash;the bass&mdash;up
      to a root that reached out over the water and to keep him until later.
      Just when he seemed to be thoroughly halter-broken he succeeded in untying
      the knot and we saw him no more. All this was bad enough, but to make a
      complete job of our discomfiture the minnow-trap which was supposed to be
      busily at work luring bait for our use, suddenly and unaccountably
      disappeared. Then the outer pail of the new minnow-bucket was missing and
      the scaler could not be found. It rained and then rained some more. The
      bass absolutely refused to strike at a spoon-hook or pork rind or the new
      Dowagiac. Why did we ever leave our happy home?
    </p>
    <p>
      It is always darkest just before dawn. The outer pail of the new
      minnow-bucket had been borrowed by a Methodist preacher who was camping
      nearby, and was returned the same afternoon. The minnow-trap had been
      rolled out into deep water by the under-tow, and within twenty-four hours
      of its disappearance was back in its accustomed place and hard at work.
      The scaler reappeared as suddenly and unaccountably as it had disappeared.
      A new stringer was easily manufactured and, with a plentiful supply of
      minnows, the bass needful to adorn the stringer were easily persuaded to
      come to hook. The weather-man repented of his unkindness and gave us days
      of glorious sunshine. The lake dimpled and laughed, the pines whispered
      all kinds of friendly messages, the red-squirrels scolded at us from the
      tree-tops where they were busy cutting off pine cones, and the chipmunks
      made friendly advances as we sat by the lakeside. The moon almost turned
      night into day and night loons called to us, &ldquo;Ha! Ha! What&rsquo;s the matter
      with you? This is a beautiful world. Minnesota is the finest part of the
      world and this is the fairest spot in Minnesota. Cheer up!&rdquo; And we did.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that we have gotten out of the dumps and life is worth living, let&rsquo;s
      go fishing. What shall it be? Or will you take anything that comes your
      way? There are bass and crappies and sunfish and great northern pike, not
      to mention rock-bass and perch. The natives aver that there are also
      enormous wall-eyed pike and we believe it, although they were always out
      when we called. Thanks be! there is not a pickerel in the lake. The great
      northern pike looks much like his kinsman, the pickerel, but differs in
      body-markings, gill-covers, general shape&mdash;being more stocky&mdash;and
      especially in palatableness. He is a vigorous fighter. Mr. Louis Rhead, in
      his book on &ldquo;Fish and Fishing,&rdquo; says that neither the great northern pike
      nor the pickerel has ever been known to rise above the surface of the
      water after being hooked. If that is correct, then something new under the
      sun has happened recently, for the writer, with eighty to a hundred feet
      of line out, had a nine-pounder throw himself entirely out of the water in
      his efforts to escape. The largest ever caught in this lake weighed
      thirty-six pounds, but numbers are taken that go over ten pounds each.
      They are nearly as gamey and quite as good eating as the muskallonge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crappies are more friendly. Early in our stay we located a &ldquo;bed&rdquo; which
      never failed to respond to a call. If there is any fish in these northern
      lakes that makes a more delicious dish than fried crappies, we want to be
      introduced to it. It is not all unusual to take them weighing a pound
      each, but this seems trifling when the Methodist preacher aforementioned
      tells us that he caught seventy-five in Lake Itasca in less than an hour
      which averaged two pounds each. Bass are here in abundance but were not
      responsive this summer. Those caught were ridiculously fat.
    </p>
    <p>
      To cap the climax of attractions there is a trout stream only three miles
      away. Visit it? Rather. A friendly neighbour furnished horse and buggy and
      acted as guide. We had a few alleged angleworms, and even with these
      emaciated, scrawny apologies for bait we took enough trout to furnish a
      meal for each family represented by the anglers. The stream flows through
      a marsh and is fed by numerous springs. Where we first struck the brook
      one needed a magnifying glass to find it. How a six-inch trout manages to
      turn around in it passes understanding. It grows as it goes, however, and
      widens into quite a respectable stream during its journey of a mile.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some years now the writer has been inflicting fish stories upon the
      unsuspecting public, and the impulse is strong within him to add more to
      those already told. He has a new supply growing out of the experiences of
      the summer, and it is hard to keep them bottled up. He would gladly
      particularize concerning the ten-inch trout that was waiting for him under
      the roots of a big tamarack just where the foam had formed a shady
      hiding-place, or mention specially some of the fights with the pike. But
      the cynical skepticism of assumed friends, the frivolous, not to say
      contemptuous comments made concerning the writer&rsquo;s previous contributions
      to piscatorial knowledge, have deeply wounded his sensitive spirit, and he
      cannot summon courage to challenge renewed unkindness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just why fish stories should be discredited so readily by those who do not
      fish it is difficult to understand. Why should a man who does not know the
      difference between a spoon-hook and an ostrich feather and who cannot tell
      a sunfish from a rainbow trout sit in judgment upon the solemn assertions
      of experienced anglers? This attitude of chronic unbelief concerning the
      testimony of honest men is unbecoming. We have heard many fish stories
      during the summer, all of them true. We have even heard varying accounts
      of the same incident and have believed them all. That comes from
      possessing a trustful spirit. A gentleman told us of seeing a string of
      five fine bass and some fifteen or twenty sunfish and perch caught by a
      cottager who came over from an adjoining lake. The next day another
      gentleman gave an account of the same catch and the number of bass had
      increased to twenty-five. On the third day, as vouched for by another
      gentleman, there were one hundred bass in that string and they averaged
      between four and six pounds. Now some suspicious individuals would scoff
      at the apparent discrepancies, but it is easy to reconcile the different
      statements. The first gentleman may have seen the catch early in the day
      and the other accounts may have been based upon later accumulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the most untiring fishermen met this summer were a father and son
      who chased the great northern pike with a zeal worthy of such a cause. One
      day the father informed me that they had caught a pike weighing fifteen
      pounds the day before. Soon after the son gave his version of the capture
      and said the fish weighed eighteen pounds. But why cavil? Are we to make
      no allowance for youthful imagination? Is a little matter of three pounds
      to be allowed to spoil a good fish story?
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer ventures to record these experiences because they are not his
      own. Possibly he may be allowed to set down one other incident, inasmuch
      as it does not concern him personally: On the shore of the lake&mdash;the
      precise location was not given&mdash;once lived a farmer who owned a dog
      famed for exceptional intelligence. It occurred to the farmer that, as the
      dog loved the water and seemed interested in the fishing excursions which
      they took together, it might be possible to utilize the canine ability to
      practical ends. Fastening a trolling line to the dog&rsquo;s tail, he took him
      out upon the lake, threw him overboard and rowed rapidly to shore. Of
      course, the dog swam after the boat and had not gone far before he hooked
      on to a good-sized bass which he dragged after him to the land. The owner
      praised the dog and continued his training until the beast had become a
      proficient troller, entering into the sport with eagerness and zest. If
      the master failed to set him to work for a day or so the dog would bring
      the trolling line in his mouth and plead&mdash;as well as a dumb animal
      can&mdash;to be allowed to go fishing. If he caught a bass he would give
      two barks to announce the capture, and if a pike three barks, except in
      the case of an exceptionally large one, in which case he barked from the
      time the fish struck until he had landed it. If he had the misfortune to
      hook a rock-bass or a perch he would sneak down the shore to some
      unfrequented spot and there gnaw the intruder off the hook and then go
      back to work again. Would that we could record a long life for this most
      wonderful animal, but, alas! he came to an untimely end. When but four
      years of age, in the fulness of his powers, he begged to go fishing one
      lowering day. Soon after he had begun trolling up and down the shore the
      master heard his bark of victory and, as it was continued, knew that he
      had hooked a large fish. The barks soon took on a note of anxiety,
      gradually merging into fear. Rushing down to the shore the horrified
      farmer was just in time to see the dog being rapidly drawn backward
      despite his most heroic efforts. A moment later and a great pair of jaws
      opened and enveloped both dog and bark. When, now and then, on cloudy
      days, a sound comes across the water that somewhat resembles a bark, the
      residents say to each other, &ldquo;There is the big pike that swallowed
      Perkins&rsquo; dog.&rdquo; (The writer hastens to say that he did not see the dog nor
      the pike nor even the bark.)
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time some reader may be interested to know where the lake is
      located about which we are writing. A journey of two hundred miles almost
      due north from Minneapolis brings the traveller to Park Rapids, a live and
      growing town on the Great Northern Railroad. One may not travel far in any
      direction from this town without coming across a lake. Three miles to the
      east is Long Lake, some nine miles in length with an average width of
      about three-fourths of a mile. It is a beautiful sheet of water,
      spring-fed, blue, with sandy beaches and broken, wooded shores. Here among
      the pines is the cottage where we spent a delightful outing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless all signs fail, this section is soon to become the favourite
      playground of the Mississippi Valley. It has almost innumerable attractive
      lakes, the fragrant pines are everywhere, the air is pure and
      invigorating, the fishing is varied and first-class. Twenty-four miles
      from Park Rapids is Lake Itasca, whose fame has gone abroad, for it is
      here that the mighty Mississippi has its source. It lies within the state
      park, which includes thirty-six thousand acres of land, and here are found
      magnificent specimens of the great Norway pine, once so common over all
      this country. The superintendent of the park is given the privilege of
      conducting a summer resort on the shores of Lake Itasca, and the central
      lodge and adjoining cottages, all built of pine logs, are very attractive.
      An automobile trip on an ideal day gave an opportunity for visiting this
      interesting place. We wondered, as we approached the lodge, at seeing the
      boarders playing tennis and pitching quoits when ten rods away was the
      lake and fishing. But more intimate acquaintance with the lake dispelled
      the wonder. The shoreline is timbered and beautiful, but the water looks
      dead, and not a sand beach is to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now all in the past except the memory. That will abide. The last
      afternoon of our stay we rowed across the lake and picked a gunny-sack
      full of hazel nuts, took a swim in the lake, and then built a fire on the
      shore over which we roasted the delicious sweetcorn, took our supper in
      the open, and rowed home as the shadows deepened and the crescent moon
      hung low in the western sky. We shall often recall the sunny days and
      peace-filled nights, the glory of the sunsets and the enticement of the
      beautiful lake. Possibly we shall feel, at times, the tingle generated by
      the big bass or the ten-inch trout. Certainly we shall live over again the
      picnics in the pine woods and the days spent in the boat voyaging in
      search of the wary bass.

      T was on the Steamer &ldquo;Empress,&rdquo; plying between Point du Chene and
      Summerside, that the Preacher said to his small son, &ldquo;Yonder is the land.&rdquo;
       The boy gazed intently for a moment and then solemnly remarked, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
      the Land of Nod.&rdquo; Great chap, that boy! for to his many other
      accomplishments he added in that hour the gift of prophecy. It is the Land
      of Nod, for every one you meet on Prince Edward Island gives you a
      friendly nod, and after you have been there a few hours all tendency to
      pursue the strenuous life departs, and the summit of earthly bliss is
      found in sitting under the shade of an apple tree and nodding at nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frankness demands a confession; namely, the Preacher went to Prince Edward
      Island to loaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not in search of a divinity school, or a summer assembly, or a
      wealthy church paying fifty dollars per Sunday for supplies. He sought a
      spot where committee meetings and mosquitoes and dust and noise are
      unknown; where he could have unlimited supplies of fresh vegetables, milk,
      cream, johnny-cake and cornmeal mush; where he could tickle his lungs with
      the breath of the sea, and, above all, where the trout hold a reception
      every day in the week&mdash;except Sunday. Do I hear some dyspeptic,
      pessimistic preacher saying, &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t any such place?&rdquo; Skepticism is
      not strange in one whose cup of bliss runs over when he finds a place
      where two cottages are built on a forty-foot lot and where he can plunge
      into the wild dissipation of croquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few good trout streams flow past the front door of a summer hotel. It is
      necessary, as a rule, even on Prince Edward Island, to journey beyond the
      dooryard before coming to the favourite haunts of that festive fish. The
      walking is good? Yes, but the Preacher found a way that beats walking all
      to death. Have a man at the hotel where you are stopping, who keeps his
      own team and coachman; who counts that day lost in which he catches no
      trout; who is intelligent, genial, unselfish; who invites you daily to
      share his buggy in trips to streams that swarm with fish. Such a man there
      is (so far as the writer knows there is but one on the North American
      continent), and the Preacher found him. Do I hear pathetic cries from my
      brother preachers piscatorially inclined, asking, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where does he live?&rdquo; S-s-h! my dear brethren. He is pre-empted by the
      writer, and to protect you from any temptation to trespass, we&rsquo;ll just
      call him the Judge. Only the writer&rsquo;s unimpeachable veracity as a teller
      of fish stories will save him from mild suspicion when he makes the
      following statement: The Judge, who knew every pool for ten miles around
      where the big trout rendezvous, insisted that the Preacher should have
      first chance at these fascinating spots. Don&rsquo;t believe it? Well, no one
      can blame you for your skepticism, for in the annals of fishermen from the
      days of Izaak Walton until now, no other such example of self-abnegation
      is to be found.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on a Monday morning that the Judge and the Preacher made their
      first descent upon the unsuspecting trout. The point of attack was on a
      tidal stream known as Tryon Creek. Some of the writer&rsquo;s friends have
      grinned derisively when he has told them of the &ldquo;sea-trout&rdquo; of Prince
      Edward Island, and one listener opined that &ldquo;weak-fish&rdquo; were probably
      meant. Of course there are always a few people around who enjoy the rare
      delights of omniscience, and it is useless to offer information to such.
      But for the benefit of the uninformed and open-minded let it be said that
      in every tidal stream on the south shore of Prince Edward Island, the
      well-known, square-tailed, speckled trout are found. They run up with the
      tide and, while many go back as the tide ebbs, a few remain in the pools.
      It was in pursuit of these sea-trout that we sallied forth on this Monday
      morning. The tide was full when we reached the stream, the sun shone from
      an unclouded sky, the wind had gone to sleep, and the rank marsh grass hid
      innumerable pit-falls. Picking our way along we cast industriously, in the
      middle of the stream, near the right bank, near the left bank, up stream,
      down stream&mdash;and not the suspicion of a response. Just to break the
      monotony the Preacher stepped into a bog-hole and disappeared,
      temporarily, from view. In response to the Judge&rsquo;s anxious query, &ldquo;Where
      are you?&rdquo; a smothered voice from the vicinity of the grassroots answered,
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m right here.&rdquo; That ended the marsh fishing for that day, and the
      disgusted pair wended their way to a pool at the head of tide-water, where
      their labour was not in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little after the noon hour the Judge said, &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll go up to Mr.
      &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&lsquo;s and get some lunch.&rdquo; If there is any home
      on the south shore of Prince Edward Island where the Judge has not a
      hearty welcome waiting for him we did not find it. Under a tent on the
      lawn we sat at ease, while the hospitable hostess brought forth great
      dishes of luscious strawberries, pitchers of cream, delicious bread and
      butter, and then mourned because we would not go into the house and have
      something to eat. It was with that at-peace-with-all-the-world feeling,
      which is begotten of strawberries and cream, that we turned our faces once
      more towards Tryon Creek. The Judge said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try the pond.&rdquo; Now
      fishing from the shore of a pond is torture to the sensitive soul of a
      true sportsman, so it came to pass that no sooner did we behold a canoe
      tied to the bank than preparations were made for a voyage of discovery. We
      discovered, all right. The Judge is a man of parts, and his fishing weight
      is about 250 pounds. He perched himself on the deck at one end of the
      canoe and invited the Preacher to balance him on the other. The
      proposition seemed to admit of debate, but the Preacher&mdash;accustomed
      to doing as he is told&mdash;clambered into the place assigned him. Then a
      kind friend pushed off the canoe and&mdash;never mind the particulars, but
      we know by accurate measurement that the water at that point reaches
      exactly from the Judge&rsquo;s hips to his armpits when he is in a sitting
      posture. The canoe being righted the Judge insisted that the Preacher
      should enjoy it alone while he would skirmish along the shore. This
      arrangement resulted satisfactorily to all parties&mdash;unless we may
      except the trout&mdash;and long before sundown, the creels were filled and
      the horse&rsquo;s head was turned towards home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writer has too much consideration for the feelings of his readers to
      undertake a detailed account of all the fishing experiences of a six
      weeks&rsquo; vacation, but he is not to be choked off until he has hinted at
      some of the things missed by those who were not there.

      Dixon&rsquo;s Mill! How the nerves of the right arm tingle just at the writing
      of those two words! It was thereabouts that some of the greatest days of
      the summer were spent, for the pond above the mill and the pool below
      furnished unfailing supplies of noble trout. The pond was bordered on one
      side by a steep hill, clothed from water&rsquo;s edge to summit with sombre fir.
      On the other side were the miller&rsquo;s garden and the meadow. One afternoon
      the Judge paddled the Preacher about this pond while the latter
      industriously whipped the water with his flies. A more responsive
      congregation that Preacher never had. They slept not nor slumbered, but
      were up and coming from introduction to &ldquo;finally.&rdquo; Twenty-three trout,
      filling a fifteen-pound creel, were the fruits of his joyous toil. Then,
      just as the sun had gone down behind the fir trees and the night shadows
      began to thicken, we addressed ourselves to the waiting throng below the
      mill. There were quick and constant responses, but they did not count in
      comparison with the swirl made by one old veteran as he lunged at and
      missed the fly. Quickly the fly was recovered and cast again, and still
      again, for many a time. Had he been pricked? Had he seen his enemy even in
      the dim twilight? No, for here he is again, and this time his aim is sure.
      Back and forth he rushes, the light rod bending in perfect harmony to his
      movements, until the lusty foeman has made his last run and lies exhausted
      in the net. He is fresh from the sea, beautiful as a dream, the perfection
      of form and colouring.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on Dixon&rsquo;s Pond that the Junior hooked his first fish. Don&rsquo;t blame
      him for neglected opportunities, for he was not quite three years old and
      this was his first chance. It was where an ice-cold stream comes tumbling
      from the hillside into the pond, and a kindly fate had decreed that a fir
      tree should fall at just this spot. What a combination! No wonder that
      this was a favourite tryst-ing place for big trout! But it had its
      disadvantages, as any one will recognize who has undertaken to direct the
      movements of a trout that has a hook in its mouth and a tree-top handy.
      The Junior hooked a lusty fellow and, with some aid from the Senior,
      managed to get him to the top of the water, and then there was a lashing
      and a splashing that caused the small boy to open his eyes in
      astonishment. Another instant and the commotion was at an end, the trout
      was gone&mdash;and the hook left fondly clinging to a submerged limb.
      Silence&mdash;and then the Junior remarked philosophically, &ldquo;That fish
      spread his wings and flew away.&rdquo; Let no one fancy that the young man
      accepted defeat as his portion, for a little later he captured, by his own
      unaided prowess, two trout that must have weighed, together, at least four
      ounces. These were carefully wrapped in paper and formed a portion of his
      next morning&rsquo;s meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      We submit that a well-trained Preacheress should spend the summer vacation
      sitting on the hotel piazza busy with her &ldquo;tatting.&rdquo; (Don&rsquo;t read that
      &ldquo;tattling,&rdquo; please.) But there is at least one of this honoured class who,
      at certain intervals, abjures fancy work and insists upon going fishing.
      This aforesaid assistant pastor and her young daughter did, upon a certain
      day in August, with malice aforethought, sit on the logs at Ive&rsquo;s Mill and
      most wilfully and maliciously deceive some forty innocent and confiding
      trout. Then, when the slaughter was done for that afternoon, these two,
      with the Senior and the Junior, the Judge and two young friends, sat on
      the grass by the singing brook, just where some great trees cast their
      shadows, and regaled themselves with the lunch so kindly provided by our
      hostess.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the Preacher was left to himself. The Judge was away on business,
      the Preacheress felt no stir of ambition towards piscatorial conquests,
      and the desolate man was compelled by force of circumstances to go it
      alone. That was the day when he discovered the unexpected resources of
      Matheson&rsquo;s Bridge. This bridge spans the stream at the head of Dixon&rsquo;s
      Pond. It is not a public highway and is used only by the owner of the
      farm. The water has worn down the bed of the stream until there is a depth
      of some four feet, and it occurred to the Preacher that here was a likely
      place for good-sized trout. Warily he approached and cast from the upper
      side, letting his lure float down under the bridge and then gently drawing
      it up the stream. The next instant he knew that his intuitions had not
      deceived him. A struggle, and then a glorious trout lay glistening in the
      sunshine. The farmer, who was waging a war of extermination against potato
      bugs on a neighbouring hillside, came down and lent his countenance to the
      stranger poaching on his preserves. To make it short, from under that
      bridge that afternoon came twelve trout that weighed not less than ten
      pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      One more experience must be told. The Judge, the Preacher and the
      Southerner had gone up the de Sable River at high tide in a dory. Their
      theory was that after fishing around Dixon&rsquo;s Mill they would float back on
      the receding tide. The theory as to the fishing and the receding of the
      tide proved trustworthy; but the floating was a delusion. The fact is,
      they fished too long, the tide had gone out, and the dory would float only
      as it was dragged. The Southerner declared that he was incapacitated for
      violent physical exertion, and furnished his share of the necessary toil
      in the shape of large chunks of advice. As a self-acting dispenser of
      gratuitous counsel he was immense. Behold the Judge at one end of the boat
      and the Preacher at the other, shoes and stockings off, trousers rolled
      above the knees, tugging and straining at that heavy boat to induce it to
      float in three inches of water! When they were fairly stuck fast and it
      looked as if the boat could never be stirred again until floated by the
      next tide, the reproving voice of the passenger would be heard assuring
      the perspiring propellers that it was all their own fault; that if they
      had kept a little this way or to that side, all would have been well. As
      they listened, the wonder grew in their minds that Job ever allowed the
      friends who visited him in the capacity of an advisory committee to escape
      with their lives. But it takes more than a heavy dory and an
      unappreciative passenger to discourage men who are firm believers in the
      perseverance of the saints, and the Judge and the Preacher hauled their
      burden through a mile of mud and water, and live to tell the tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fair Prince Edward Island! Across the years the Preacher sees your smiling
      fields and sober woods and hears the beat of the surf and the tinkle of
      silver streams. Land of trout! Land of peace! Land of Nod!

    <p>
      S an old proverb goes, &ldquo;It is the unexpected that happens.&rdquo; This ancient
      saw, seemed to find illustration when some one called out, as we were
      sitting at breakfast, &ldquo;Come out and see this big trout!&rdquo; We were on the
      St. Johns River and the steamer had tied up at a landing to take on wood.
      A trout in Florida! Somehow that experience had not been among our
      anticipations when we planned the trip; but why should not the unexpected
      happen in Florida as well as elsewhere? Knowing that it is never safe to
      be too skeptical concerning any statement which concerns fishing or fish,
      we joined the company of investigators. On the pier was a lad of fourteen
      or fifteen, holding up for inspection a fish that was, indeed, big, but to
      northern eyes gave no indications of being a trout. It was a giant
      &ldquo;big-month&rdquo; bass, and the lad&rsquo;s assertion that it weighed twelve pounds
      seemed quite probable. It seems ridiculous to call the handsome speckled
      denizens of clear, mountain streams, and the brown, ugly frequenter of the
      muddy St. Johns by the same name, but there is no law forbidding such
      trespass. When we reach the coast we find the weakfish has also been
      transformed into a trout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The &ldquo;dead rivers&rdquo; that abound along the St. Johns are well named, although
      they are not rivers at all, but bayous. They have no perceptible current,
      and the stagnant water furnishes a most satisfactory habitat for
      alligators. One day, when we had committed ourselves to the care of a
      negro boatman, we spent a forenoon in one of these dead rivers, catching
      an occasional bass and shooting curlew and fox squirrels. Passing a
      tree-top that had fallen into the water, the boatman told us that he had
      seen a number of little &lsquo;gators drop into the water as we approached, and
      said that he would catch us some if we wished. Rowing quietly up to the
      tree-top, he watched the surface of the water for a little time and then,
      making a quick grab, held up a little wriggling alligator some eight or
      ten inches long. This was repeated until he had captured five, and we
      informed him that these were all we could use to advantage. It is said
      that the relentless warfare waged against the alligator by tourists and
      native hunters who covet his hide has made him a rarity, at least along
      the lines of travel, but twenty-five years ago, no one who visited Florida
      need fail of a sight of this ugly saurian. Coming home in the afternoon of
      the day spent with the negro boatman, our attention was called to the
      swaying of the marsh grass not far distant, and the negro informed us that
      it was caused, he thought, by an alligator. With guns at cock and all
      ready to open a fusillade on the first appearance of the game, a cautious
      approach was made until we were alongside the grass. Then, as we were
      standing in the boat, peering this way and that in an effort to spy our
      victim, there was an unexpected rush, the boat was given a whack that
      almost caused the hunters to fall overboard, and we had a fleeting glimpse
      of our quarry as he disappeared in the waters of the river. The
      performance was so unexpected and so soon over that not a shot was fired.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years the Indian River country has been a prime favourite with
      those who visit Florida. The so-called river is really a long, narrow arm
      of the sea, and at some points, a walk of five minutes brings one from the
      river to the ocean. The soil along this river is exceedingly fertile, and
      some of the finest orange groves in the state are found at Rock Ledge and
      farther south. This body of water furnishes ideal conditions for sailing,
      hunting and fishing, and nothing can be more delightful than a cruise of a
      few days with congenial companions. We hired a sharpie, a flat-bottomed
      sailboat of such light draft that it is commonly said of it that it &ldquo;will
      sail in a dew,&rdquo; and with a generous supply of oranges on board set off
      from Rock Ledge towards the south. Some fishing, some duck-shooting, much
      idling and orange eating, served to make the days pass like a happy dream.
      When night came it was not difficult to find some winter-hotel with
      comfortable accommodations. Not infrequently night had fallen before we
      reached the desired haven, and the water would turn to silver as the
      mullet darted here and there before the slow-moving boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day we anchored at the mouth of the Banana River, that members of the
      party who had never seen the ocean, might walk across the narrow spit of
      land that separates between the river and the Atlantic. One of the
      company, to whom the sea was no novelty, elected to remain on board, moved
      to this decision, in part at least, by the fact that he had secured some
      bait the night before that as yet he had been unable to use. Left to
      himself, he began operations at once, and soon landed a seven-pound
      channel bass. This seemed pretty good to the lone fisherman, but he had no
      sooner put on a fresh piece of mullet and thrown out than another tug at
      his line assured him that &ldquo;the best is yet to be.&rdquo; Despite the angler&rsquo;s
      most skilful manipulations that fish had its own way at first. It went
      down, down, until the anxious fisherman saw that the line remaining on the
      reel must be measured by inches. Then it decided upon a reversal, and came
      up so rapidly that only by reeling madly was the line kept taut. After
      that the fish took a notion to circumnavigate the boat, which he proceeded
      to do in spite of protests from the fisherman. When one is fishing from a
      row-boat with anchor safely stowed away in the bow, there can be no
      serious objections urged if the fish decides to describe a circle about
      the boat; but on a sail-boat at anchor, the case is radically different.
      It is not easy to manipulate your rod successfully under the anchor rope,
      crawl under the boom, keep clear of the rudder, and never, for a second,
      give the fish the least slack line. One such experience is more than
      enough, and when that fish repeated the performance three times he almost
      exhausted the fisherman&rsquo;s patience. But all things have an end, even the
      antics of a fish that objects to being caught, and at last the sturdy
      fighter began to grow amenable to discipline. Slowly, line was reeled in
      and, after many flurries and plunges, he was landed safely in the boat.
      Natives assured the captor that eighteen pounds was not very large for a
      channel bass; but even their efforts to minimize the importance of the
      event did not entirely destroy the angler&rsquo;s satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there is a more uninteresting ride anywhere than that from Palatka to
      Charlotte Harbour, we do not care to find it. Scrub palmetto, pines, sand,
      and then sand, pines and scrub palmetto, until the traveller almost wishes
      the engine would jump the track or bandits hold up the train to break the
      deadly monotony. After all, that day is a red-letter one, for during it
      the writer made a friend. At noon, the train stopped near a lonely
      building in the pine woods to allow the passengers to dine. Other bills of
      fare may be forgotten, but the menu that noon is imperishably engraved on
      the tablets of memory. Who would not remember a meal consisting of
      saleratus biscuits&mdash;with strong emphasis upon the saleratus&mdash;&ldquo;sides&rdquo;
       of pork and sweet potato pie? It is conceivable that even these may be
      palatable when well cooked, but the materials used that day had evidently
      had no fair chance to reveal their excellence when skilfully treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the passengers was a tall, somewhat gaunt man, with long, brown hair
      and a straggling-beard just showing a hint of grey. The face was rugged
      but kindly, and the eyes deep-set. One felt, instinctively, that here was
      a man of power and goodness whom it would be a privilege to know, and when
      a chance remark made by him to the traveller from the north gave an excuse
      for further conversation it was eagerly seized upon. It was not until the
      train was approaching Charlotte Harbour that we learned the name of our
      travelling companion, a name familiar, then and now, the world over, among
      those who look and long for a better day for man&mdash;Edward Everett
      Hale. His destination was the same as our own&mdash;Pine Island&mdash;where
      we spent three delightful weeks, the greatest pleasure of which was his
      companionship. After we had been at the little hotel on Pine Island two or
      three days, the proprietor approached the writer with something of unusual
      timidity in his manner, and ventured the information that Doctor Hale
      would preach in the school house the next Sunday. &ldquo;Would you dare to
      assist in the service?&rdquo; he hesitatingly asked. &ldquo;Dare to take part in the
      service? Why not? What danger would there be?&rdquo; &ldquo;But you know he is a
      Unitarian, and I understand you are a Baptist. I didn&rsquo;t know but some one
      would make trouble for you if they should hear that you had joined in a
      service with a Unitarian,&rdquo; said the kind-hearted landlord. When assured
      that we were quite ready to run the risk, he went out with beaming face to
      tack up his notices. Among many sermons heard from many preachers, good,
      bad and indifferent, the outline of Doctor Hale&rsquo;s sermon on that Sunday
      morning, in the little school house, is the only one that refuses to be
      forgotten. He chose for treatment the story of the rich young man who came
      to Jesus asking what he should do to gain eternal life, and gave his
      interpretation of the true life. In a quiet, conversational manner, he set
      forth his conception of the ideal for the individual and for society as
      living &ldquo;with God, for man, in heaven.&rdquo; The points were driven home by the
      use of homely but telling illustrations, and, after the passing of many
      years, one, at least, of those who listened that day, feels the glow and
      thrill begotten of this fine setting forth of the possibilities in
      manhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most vivid pictures of Doctor Hale which those days furnished
      is, as he stands on the government pier at Sanibel Island fishing for
      sheepshead. He wore a long, linen duster, used a cane-pole without a reel,
      and the fish that came to his hook were usually made to describe the arc
      of a circle, landing with a resounding thump on the pier. After fishing
      had ceased to be attractive, owing to the undue eagerness of the
      sheepshead to be caught, the party wandered across the island to the outer
      shore where the waters of the Gulf of Mexico came tumbling in upon the
      beach, and shells were numerous and beautiful. On the way one bought a
      fine specimen of the saw of a sawfish from the Cuban fisherman, and
      another shot a diamond-back rattlesnake which lay coiled in the path. We
      were becalmed that night on the sail home, and Doctor Hale&rsquo;s varied
      experiences were drawn upon to alleviate the monotony of the long wait for
      a favourable wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rattlers were treated with the utmost respect by all the guests after
      a resident physician had told us that in an experience of more than twenty
      years in southern Florida he had never known any one to survive the bite
      of a diamondback rattlesnake. When one of the visitors would go up the
      island after deer he preferred to mount a pony and undertake to shoot from
      its back rather than to trudge through the dense undergrowth when any step
      might bring him within striking distance of this dreaded reptile. When a
      gentleman from Boston related an experience which he had two years before
      at the very point where the hotel had since been built, the reluctance on
      the part of the visitors to come into close quarters with Florida rattlers
      sensibly increased. He was one of a party of four who were cruising along
      the gulf coast in a sharpie. They landed at the foot of Pine Island, and
      two of the party started up the island after deer. They walked about a
      hundred yards apart, and had not gone far when one heard his companion&rsquo;s
      gun go off and called out asking what he had shot. Getting no reply, he
      hastened to his friend, whom he found on the ground and by him a
      rattlesnake which he had shot. The snake had struck him in the calf of the
      leg, and in spite of everything that could be done, the man died before
      night.

      The first visit of a northerner to this section is certain to be filled
      with novel experiences. Never before has he seen oysters growing on trees,
      but here, at low tide, this phenomenon may be observed at any time. The
      so-called &ldquo;coon&rdquo; oysters attach themselves to the boughs which droop over
      and into the water at high tide, and when the tide has gone out they are
      left hanging in great masses, high, if not dry. The little fiddler crabs,
      swarming by thousands in the sand of the beach, waving their single arm
      frantically in the air, were an unfailing source of amusement. Pelicans
      abounded, and a part of the day&rsquo;s program was to feed mullet to the two
      tame ones which made their headquarters on the pier. Through long practice
      and because of the capacious bag which they carry, they could catch, with
      almost unfailing accuracy, every fish pitched in their direction. Every
      day some of the visitors fished from the pier for sharks. Probably this
      sport has its fascination for those who enjoy that sort of thing, but when
      it is considered that from this same pier one might catch many varieties
      of excellent food fish, the passion for shark fishing becomes an
      impenetrable mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably no one who fishes at all can withstand the temptation to try his
      hand at tarpon when visiting the Gulf of Mexico waters. One hears such
      stories of the gaminess of this fish, of the fight, prolonged through many
      hours, at times, which is necessary to land it, that he soon contracts the
      tarpon fever. In spite of a certain reluctance to go in pursuit of fish
      which are good for nothing when caught, fish that have never injured us
      and against which we hold no malice, a sunny morning saw the writer and a
      boatman starting out for tarpon. We anchored at a favourable point, the
      hook was baited with half a mullet, tied on as well as hooked, and then
      came the wait. It was not long, for in less than half an hour the
      fisherman announced to his oarsman, &ldquo;I feel something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let him have it,&rdquo; urged the boatman, for one secret of successful fishing
      for tarpon is to give the fish plenty of time to gorge the bait. After
      what seemed to be an interminable time the oarsman said, &ldquo;Now strike him.&rdquo;
       And strike him we did, with the most astonishing result. No sooner had the
      fisherman struck, than a mountain of burnished silver flung itself out of
      the water. The oarsman said it was a tarpon of average size; but to the
      fisherman he looked to be fifty feet long and to weigh a ton. Just how
      large he was will never be known, for with vicious shakes of his head he
      flung the baited hook at least fifteen feet away. Disappointed? Not
      especially. Fortunately we had never really felt that our happiness
      depended upon catching a tarpon.

      E want a quiet place, free from dudes and mosquitoes, with good good
      fishing.&rdquo; Thus food and spoke the tired city man to his friend, the
      Preacher, and the friend answered, &ldquo;I have heard of such a haven of rest,
      far in the east, on the shores of Moosehead Lake.&rdquo; So it came to pass that
      we&mdash;Nell, little Sue and I&mdash;made the long journey of 1,500 miles
      on the strength of a hearsay. Risky? Yes, but the results amply justified

      Picture to yourself a long, rambling structure, designed according to no
      known law save that of utility. Additions have been made from time to time
      to the original farm-house, resulting in a delightfully unconventional and
      straggly building; an illustration in wood of the law of evolution. Great
      barns stand guard on the east and south. Hard by, a cold brook gurgles and
      laughs on its way to the lake a few rods distant. Take your stand facing
      the west, and declare your vision. Fifteen miles away, on the western
      border of the lake, Squaw Mountain lifts its ragged line against the sky.
      On the left, and close at hand, bold hills bound the view, clothed with
      timber to their very tips. Far to the north, Spencer Bay Mountain lies
      like a giant haystack. The waters of the lake dimple and flash in the
      sunlight, the air is filled with the drowsy hum of insects, and over all
      is peace. In the words of the ancient hymn, one sings,

      Now that we are here, what shall we do? Rest? Yes, but it cannot be the
      rest of inactivity. The woods are calling to us and the waters tempt us.
      The trout are jumping in the pool just beyond the big stump, and a deer is
      feeding in the meadow yonder. Great herons fly lazily along the shores of
      the bay, or go on frog-hunting expeditions among the rushes. Surely, there
      is something better to do than to loll on the porch, and the first
      important task is to interview those impertinent trout. Leaders are
      brought out and soaked, flies selected, the Leonard rod jointed and
      everything made ready. We start for the brook which seems to be murmuring
      an invitation, only to run against a very formidable obstacle in the shape
      of the Maine game law. &ldquo;All streams flowing into Moosehead Lake are closed
      indefinitely.&rdquo; Only nine words gently spoken by the landlord, but they
      were of tremendous significance. A journey halfway across the continent to
      fish streams that cannot be fished. The arm of the fisherman is palsied,
      and his tongue cleaves to the roof of his mouth. Is this the end of all
      his bright visions? A darkness like that of Egypt settles down upon him,
      and all joy flees from his heart. Silently he anathematizes the railroad
      companies for failing to find space in their attractive circulars for this
      important piece of information. But just when his gloom is deepest, a ray
      of light appears. &ldquo;Do you see that red post?&rdquo; says the landlord, pointing
      down the stream. &ldquo;That marks the boundary between the brook and the lake.
      Below it you can fish to your heart&rsquo;s content.&rdquo;

      Really, it was not as bad as might be supposed. Fish love the mouth of a
      stream, and this mouth was of generous proportions and largely patronized
      by the trout. Many a happy hour we spent on that stretch of water below
      the post. Possibly, in the eagerness of pursuit, the fly sometimes fell
      over the line into the forbidden waters; but it is not easy to determine
      the exact location of an invisible boundary, and the trout had no business
      to gather in town-meeting just over the line and wink derisively at the
      irritated fisherman. But, on the whole, we sought to obey the law; not
      alone from respect for the law, mingled with fear of the game-warden, but,
      as well, because the best fishing was below the post. Here was a half-mile
      of water frequented by many noble trout. We will say nothing of the many
      ordinary trout taken from this stretch of stream, but the story of the
      fisherman&rsquo;s experience with one wary old grandpa of the <i>Salvelinus
      Fontinalis</i> family must be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived in a deep pool bordered by rushes, where a sunken tree-top
      afforded an excellent hiding-place. Many smaller trout had been lured from
      this retreat before the patriarch gave any sign of his presence. One day a
      huge swirl and a heavy tug set the angler&rsquo;s nerves to tingling; but the
      line came back limp, and the disappointed disciple of the immortal Izaak
      went to the house to tell of the four-pound trout that he had hooked and
      lost. A week passed, during which time the hopeful fisherman whipped every
      inch of that water many times, taking not a few, but hearing nothing from
      the veteran for whom he longed. Then, moved by hunger or contempt, or
      both, the old fellow snapped at a &ldquo;Montreal,&rdquo; and the battle was on. When
      victory for the fisherman seemed certain and the landing net was almost
      under the tired fish, he gave a mighty surge and was gone. This time he
      weighed a plump five pounds on the scales of the angler&rsquo;s imagination.
      Other days passed, and then, one evening just as the sun was setting, a
      &ldquo;Silver Doctor&rdquo; overcame the wariness of the spotted warrior, and again
      the issue was joined between man and trout. The fish knew that there was
      safety in the sunken tree-top, and made heroic efforts to reach it; but
      the fisherman knew this also, and met every rush by giving the butt of the
      rod. The boarders on the hotel veranda saw the conflict and shouted
      encouragement to the anxious angler. Canoeists stopped at a respectful
      distance to watch the struggle. Nell was at the oars and kept the boat
      well out in the middle of the pool. The light rod bent almost double as
      the sturdy fighter made his great rushes for liberty. The reel buzzed as
      the fish carried out the line, or clicked gently as the fisherman worked
      the captive towards the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any one of a great number of things may happen at such a time. The hook
      may tear out, slack line is fatal, the line may break, the snood or leader
      may part, the rod may give way, an earthquake may chance along; in short,
      there is no catastrophe which is not liable to occur when you have a big
      fish at the other end of a line. The worst of it is that all these
      possibilities visit the mind of the fisherman at once. There is one other
      possibility; namely, that you may land the fish. That is just what
      happened this time; and when he was fairly in the net that fisherman let
      forth a whoop which must have scared the foxes on Deer Island, three miles
      away. How much did he weigh? Such inquisitiveness is really painful; but
      if you must know, the scales said two pounds, fourteen ounces. All
      fishermen will understand that a fish shrinks rapidly after being taken
      from the water, and it must have been at least ten minutes after his
      capture before he was weighed. This accounts for some things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Will some wise man rise up and explain the puzzling vagaries of the trout?
      Why does he strike freely at a certain fly one day, and entirely ignore it
      on the day following? Why will he sulk for hours, and then make the water
      boil with his acrobatic exercises? One morning, when all the signs were
      propitious, Mr. D. and the writer sought the mouth of South Brook, a place
      famous in all this region for the number and size of its trout. Mrs. N., a
      veteran angler and successful, was just leaving in deep disgust. She had
      been fishing since five o&rsquo;clock and not a strike had rewarded her patient
      toil. One hour, two hours, we cast in vain. We might as well have been
      fishing in the Dead Sea so far as any signs of trout were concerned. Under
      the overhanging alders, by the side of old logs, up close to the bridge,
      down where the stream meets the bay, back and forth we went, but all in
      vain. At last, over by the big rock, a splash is heard and the widening
      ripples tell that a trout has jumped. Quietly we seek the spot. When some
      forty feet away the flies are sent on their mission, and then follows an
      experience that cannot be put into words. For fifteen minutes the water
      fairly foams, as the eager fish leap for the fantastic creations which are
      supposed to resemble different forms of insect life. The sport is fast and
      furious. Ten feet of line is as good as fifty, and a frayed fly is as
      acceptable as a fresh one. They seem to be fighting for the first chance
      at anything that is offered. Singles reward every cast, and doubles are
      not infrequent. Three of the number taken, go over a pound and a half
      each, and not one falls under half a pound. A quarter of an hour of this
      delirium, and then it is all over. We whip in vain for another hour, and
      turn towards the hotel, puzzled but happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a little time have we been in the Peaceful Valley, when moose stories
      begin to circulate. The rumour goes that Mr. P., a camper, has seen a bull
      moose in the north meadow, and watched him feed for more than an hour.
      Louise, the dining-room girl, declares that she frequently sees a moose
      feeding in the &ldquo;logan&rdquo; when she rises about daybreak. (Will some
      etymologist settle the derivation of that word &ldquo;logan&rdquo;? About Moosehead it
      seems to be applied to a bay of any sort or condition. Is it a corruption
      of &ldquo;lagoon&rdquo;?) The Higher Critic kindly calls attention to the evident
      unreliability of these stories. We know the habits of the moose. It is a
      shy animal, and seldom comes out into the open. If it should venture out
      it most certainly would not approach a summer hotel. Granting that some
      demented specimen might visit a clearing in which is a hotel, it would do
      so only under the protection of darkness. The stories are evidently
      mythical. Only a few days later the Higher Critic receives a distinct jar
      when he is awakened at early dawn one morning by a tapping at his door and
      hears a low voice saying, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a moose in the logan!&rdquo; The shadows of
      night are not entirely gone, but it is light enough to see distinctly the
      dark object standing in the water and tearing at the lily-pads. A cow? Too
      large and too high at the shoulders. A horse? No horse ever had such ears
      or such a head. Although the H. C. has never before seen a moose outside
      of a zoological garden, one glance convinces him that his theory is
      seriously damaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, as the guests are eating their midday meal, the small
      boy rushes into the dining-room and shouts, &ldquo;Moose in the logan!&rdquo; In an
      incredibly short space of time the boarders have exchanged the dining-room
      for the garden fence, and are looking down upon such a sight as even
      dwellers in the Peaceful Valley seldom see. In the middle of the logan,
      and not more than forty rods away, stands a cow moose with her calf by her
      side. The mother plunges her muzzle into the water in search of food,
      lifts her head and munches for a time, and then repeats the process. All
      the time the tail is switching at the flies, and the great ears are slowly
      moving back and forth. Neither mother nor child seems to pay any attention
      to the spectators, and both remain perfectly unconcerned until the small
      boy begins to whistle and shout. Then, without any signs of fear, they
      walk out of the water, trot slowly across the meadow and disappear in the
      woods. The H. C. sadly lays his theory away in the mausoleum where so many
      of its kindred rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time some reader is saying, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care anything about the
      moose, and less about the fishing. Didn&rsquo;t you go anywhere? Didn&rsquo;t you see
      anything worth writing about?&rdquo; The rebuke is deserved, and the writer
      hastens to say that Moosehead Lake is forty miles long and fifteen miles
      across in the widest part, having an estimated shoreline of something like
      400 miles. We saw it all, from Greenville to Southeast Carry; but he would
      be a brave man or a rash one, who would undertake to put its beauty into
      words. We drove to Roach River and, from the neighbouring hilltop, looked
      down upon the sparkling waters of Roach Pond and away across miles of
      forest to mighty Katahdin. We followed the old lumber roads into the
      depths of the wood, where the silence is broken only by the chatter of the
      red squirrel or the harsh cry of the bluejay. In the cool evenings we sat
      around the wood fire that crackled and leaped in the great open fireplace
      in the House of Rest, and heard the guides tell stories which would have
      made Baron Munchausen turn green with envy. We even went to Mountain Pond,
      six miles away, and all the way up hill. No wagon could make that trip and
      survive. The lazy man had a chronic dislike to walking six miles up hill
      on a hot August day, and, in a moment of forgetfulness, accepted the loan
      of a friend&rsquo;s horse. He had not been on a horse in fifteen years and had
      forgotten the eccentric motions which that animal makes in scrambling over
      rocks and corduroy roads. However, he lived to reach Mountain Pond, and
      spent the night with three friends in an &ldquo;A&rdquo; tent. Don&rsquo;t ask about the
      fishing, for it is a subject upon which the writer does not care to dwell.
      The wind blew a gale every hour of the day spent on Mountain Pond, and you
      can safely write the sign of equation between the results of that day&rsquo;s
      toil and those secured by Peter and his companions engaged in a similar
      enterprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      That was a never-to-be-forgotten night. The wind roared incessantly among
      the trees, the tent shook and flapped, an obtrusive root insisted upon
      being familiar with our ribs, and, to complete the enjoyment, a hedge-hog
      made us a call. That call afforded the one bit of comfort in an otherwise
      dreary night. To see the artist, in scanty attire, chasing that hedge-hog
      around the camp-fire at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning was a sight to warm the
      cockles of the heart. To the artistic temperament there was nothing
      attractive in slaughter, but if the well-armed marauder could be caught
      alive and taken down to the hotel, that would be worth while. Finally, a
      well-aimed blow stunned the animal and he was hastily thrust under an
      empty box with a sufficient number of stones piled upon it to prevent it
      from being overturned by any exertion on the part of the captive. When
      daylight came, the box was in its place, but the hedge-hog had gnawed his
      way to liberty. That we did not extract his teeth before imprisoning him
      was a fatal oversight.

      ON&rsquo;T be frightened! The writer has not turned desperado, neither has he
      fallen among men of bloody practices. In order that all minds may be set
      at rest before we go further, be it known that this is but a fish story
      pure and simple. The brother with the melancholy mind and ossified piety
      will do well to stop here and turn to &ldquo;Foxe&rsquo;s Book of Martyrs&rdquo; or some
      other literature of that order. The elect few who love the open, rejoice
      in God&rsquo;s out-of-doors and the beauty of lake and mountain, may safely
      venture to read this frivolous story of a side-trip made by one of the
      delegates to a church convention.
    </p>
    <p>
      What have cut-throats to do with fishing? Patience for a moment, you who
      live east of the Mississippi! The Pacific Coast dwellers will need no
      explanation, but for the benefit of the unenlightened it may be said that
      in common parlance the &ldquo;<i>Salmo Clarkii</i>&rdquo; is known as a &ldquo;cut-throat.&rdquo;
       This appellation has nothing to do with the character of the fish, for he
      is an eminently respectable citizen of the watery world, but is due to the
      presence of a blood-red line on either side of his throat which by an
      extreme stretch of the imagination may be made to resemble a bloody cut.
      It is said that when he has access to salt water the cut-throat ranges far
      seaward, in which case he loses his black spots and takes on a coat of
      silver; but he still holds fast to his crimson necktie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless the next question will be, &ldquo;Where is Lake Chelan?&rdquo; If you are
      too indolent to look it up on the map of Washington, follow the trail of
      the fisherman. He took the Great Northern road from Seattle, crossed the
      beautiful Cascade Mountains and left the train at Wenatchee. It is alleged
      in a multitude of highly coloured circulars that this is the &ldquo;home of the
      big, red apple.&rdquo; A trustful habit of mind makes us ready to believe this,
      although the aforesaid big, red apple was not at home when we were there.
      He is expected to return in the fall. There are orchards and orchards, and
      then more orchards.
    </p>
    <p>
      An enthusiastic friend had pictured the beauties of the Columbia River
      Valley, and when we took the boat at Wenatchee for a forty-mile ride
      up-stream, anticipation stood on tip-toe. To be sure, aside from the
      orchards there was nothing attractive in the country around Wenatchee, but
      we felt sure that it would be &ldquo;better farther on.&rdquo; But it wasn&rsquo;t. Possibly
      our æsthetic sense had suffered from a stroke of paralysis; if not, a
      muddy river, sage brush and alkali dust, brown, treeless hills and a
      general air of desolation do not combine to form an entrancing picture. To
      be sure, there are spots of green where fruit-trees have been planted and
      water from the river or from some irrigation ditch is led in and out
      through the orchard. But to one who has seen the beauty of an eastern
      landscape, before whose eyes comes a vision of stately trees and luxuriant
      meadows and babbling brooks of clear, cold water, those little dabs of
      green in the midst of wide stretches of dreariness awaken pity and not
      admiration. There is nothing either in the accommodations on the boat or
      in the scenery to make the traveller long to repeat his ride from
      Wenatchee to Chelan Falls.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said to be four miles from Chelan Falls, on the Columbia River, to
      the foot of Lake Chelan. We believe it, and would just as readily believe
      that it is ten miles. The fact is that the miles are perpendicular. You
      are either going up or down all of the time. Lake Chelan lies four hundred
      feet above the Columbia River, and the road borders the stream through
      which Lake Chelan discharges its waters. On second thought that word
      &ldquo;borders&rdquo; does not fit. The road transcends the stream; looks down upon
      it. At one point in the journey you gaze downwards some five hundred feet
      upon the boiling, turbulent waters which have made a way for themselves
      through a crevice in the rock. The colour reminds one of his boyhood when
      he interviewed the bluing water in the family wash-tub.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lake Chelan, at last, and a hotel for the night, as the boat does not
      leave for the upper end of the lake until morning. It was an eventful
      night not only because the inhabitants of the village were celebrating the
      &ldquo;glorious Fourth,&rdquo; but chiefly from an important archaeological discovery
      made by the writer. Many of our readers are familiar with the account
      given in the Bible of the pillow upon which Jacob spent a dream-filled
      night. That identical pillow is in a hotel at Lakeside. It must be
      confessed that this is a deduction and lacks absolute historical
      verification; but as Jacob&rsquo;s pillow was of stone and the Lakeside pillow
      is of the same material, and inasmuch as we have no record of any other
      pillow of that kind, it is a fair inference that Jacob&rsquo;s famous head-rest
      has been identified. If any one questions the deduction let him try the
      pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is fifty-one miles from the foot of Lake Chelan to its head, and with
      each mile as one goes north the scenery grows more beautiful. The
      mountains at the lower end of the lake rise to a height of three or four
      thousand feet, while at the upper end they tower nine thousand feet almost
      precipitously from the water. The water of the lake is clear and blue, the
      mountains crowd upon it in their silent majesty, the air is clean and
      refreshing.
    </p>
    <p>
      On some still morning when the winds do not disturb the bosom of the lake,
      nature is at its best. In the lake we saw pictures that cannot be
      reproduced by any skill of man; miles of flawless mirror in which
      mountains and crags and trees and clouds were reproduced with matchless
      fidelity. Sometimes the clouds hung for hours over the summits of the
      mountains, and here and there were great masses of snow which no summer
      heat could banish. Looking up the valley of the Stehekin towards the
      north, twenty-five miles away rises a huge mountain, down the side of
      which a giant glacier makes its way. And the best of all is that here one
      is &ldquo;far from the madding crowd.&rdquo; At the head of the lake is a hotel and a
      fish hatchery; no store, no factory, not even a Chautauqua.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has taken a long time to get to the cut-throats, but we have arrived at
      last. The books on fishing assure one that the cut-throat &ldquo;takes the
      artificial fly greedily,&rdquo; and all the way the right arm has been fairly
      tingling with anxiety to begin casting. Alas! and again alas! The hotel
      clerk says that it is too early for the fly; we must use bait or a spoon.
      It is the old story over again. Did you ever travel far to a famous
      fishing ground and find the conditions just right? It is always too early
      or too late, the water is too high or too low, something is the matter
      which effectually prevents the best sport. But the man who has lugged a
      bundle of fly-rods to the church convention that he might use them on Lake
      Chelan is slow to believe that all his enterprise has been in vain. He
      will give them a try before abandoning hope. Behold him, then, whipping
      patiently on the edge of sand bars, in the swift water, under over-hanging
      bushes, in the shadows of great rocks, here, there, everywhere except on
      the board walk and the roof of the hotel; but so far as results are
      concerned he might as well have cast his flies in State Street, Chicago.
      Nothing doing; not even the feeblest answer to his invitation. Meanwhile a
      fellow-boarder is fishing with bait, using a bamboo pole about sixteen
      feet long and derricking fish in with a regularity that is equalled only
      by his evident ignorance of all the fundamental principles of true sport.
      But he gets the fish. If one is fishing for market he may use a telegraph
      pole or a net; but if he has in him something of the temper of the famous
      Izaak, fishing is more than meat. He loves the water and the sky, is made
      captive by the beauty of stream and mountain, delights to pit his wits
      against those of the wary citizens of the pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      But what is to be done? No one has yet been found who can compel a trout
      to go after the fly when he does not wish to. We troll with a Dowagiac
      spinner, and the result, in number of fish, is distinctly satisfactory. As
      the trolling is done with a steel rod there is a certain amount of sport
      in the exercise; but at the best it is far below fly-fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      This story, thus far, has been written with careful attention to facts in
      order that it may bear the scrutiny of certain friends who companied with
      the writer for a short time at the head of the lake. They were good men
      and true, lovers of God&rsquo;s out-of-doors, delightful comrades. Their company
      was a joy, but their presence was embarrassing. Every one knows that
      witnesses are unnecessary in fishing. To have some one at your elbow who
      wants to know just how many you have caught and what they weigh, allows no
      room for that play of the imagination which gives to fish stories their
      indefinable charm. It was a dark hour for the writer when these good
      friends turned their faces towards the south and left him desolate, but it
      was then that the fishing really began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just where the Stehekin makes its final plunges before joining the lake,
      there is a reach of rippling water bordered on one side by low-growing
      trees, and on the other by a great bunch of drift-wood. The fly-rod was
      put in commission, a sinker was used, and a bit of the white throat of a
      trout took the place of the artificial lure. With the boat lying against
      the drift-wood a cast was made towards the trees, the bait allowed to sink
      and then drawn slowly towards the boat. Was that the bottom? Hardly, for
      it is tugging and lunging and rushing back and forth across the narrow
      water. The light bamboo meets every lunge, and the fight goes merrily on
      for ten minutes or so, when a beautiful Dolly Varden trout is brought to
      net. Another cast and another strike. This time the visitor has succeeded
      in getting on the other side of a log that juts out into the stream from
      the drift-wood. So much the better for the sport. Gently, little by
      little, he is persuaded to travel towards the end of that log, until,
      after many efforts, the line swings free. A long, delightful tussle, and
      he joins his comrade in the bottom of the boat. Lest the reader&rsquo;s patience
      should give way under the strain of detailed description, suffice it to
      say that from that one spot six Dolly Vardens were taken, not one of which
      weighed less than three pounds.

      But fly-fishing was found, such as it was. Two miles up the valley Boulder
      Creek comes down the canon and empties into the Stehekin. We were told
      that here one could catch mountain trout with the fly. A mile beyond
      Boulder Creek are the Rainbow Falls, where a stream drops over the eastern
      mountains for a sheer plunge of three hundred and twenty feet. One day was
      all too little to devote to the beauty of this scenery and an excursion up
      Boulder, but it was a day well spent. The trout were there; little fellows
      among whom a nine-inch fish was a giant. The farther one went up the canon
      the better the fishing grew and the more plentiful and vindictive the
      mosquitoes became. The fish bit readily and the mosquitoes more readily.
      One could have filled a basket with small fish, but after saving a dozen
      for dinner the rest were thrown back. Zest was added to this excursion by
      the information that rattlesnakes frequented these rocky slopes; so the
      fisherman walked softly and kept an eye to windward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mountains and forests, dancing streams and beautiful lake, quiet and&mdash;fish!
      What more could one wish who seeks rest for tired nerves? Some time they
      will build a railroad in there, and then Lake Chelan will be easier of
      access, but less to be desired than now. When the crowds come, half of its
      present charm will be lost.

    <p>
      F that is plagiarism, make the most of it. It is a fact. There was the
      Business Man, the Doctor and the Preacher; fishermen all. They preferred
      to roll rather than to sail, because they were in a hurry. They rolled
      north rather than west, because the best trout stream in North America
      lies between Chicago and Hudson&rsquo;s Bay. Who has not heard of the famous
      Nepigon? What angler has not dreamed of battling with the giant trout
      which inhabit its waters? For months the Business Man, the Doctor and the
      Preacher had been examining their rods, looking over tackle, selecting
      flies, laying plans and looking forward with feverish anxiety to August
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening of that day found us on board a vestibule Northwestern train,
      bound for Duluth and the Nepigon. At Duluth we exchanged rolling for
      sailing&mdash;by steam. If the weather had been at all nasty, we should
      have combined rolling with sailing; for the little tub which plies between
      Port Arthur and Duluth was evidently designed to exemplify all the
      possibilities in the way of tumbling about. But Lake Superior was on its
      good behaviour, with its face as smooth and calm as that of a sportsman
      when he has just landed a five-pound trout. The captain was one of the
      most genial of men, and the cook was undoubtedly a genius. We were not
      privileged to meet him personally, but we had abundant evidence of his
      culinary skill. The memory of his soup will linger with us forever. After
      mature deliberation we unanimously agreed that it was unlike anything we
      had ever tasted. We tasted it but once, for whatever other failings we may
      have, we are not greedy&mdash;at least for soup made from a strong
      decoction of musty hay, flavoured with extract of logwood. The polite
      waiter, observing that the Business Man was playing with the soup spoon
      instead of eating, mercifully inquired, &ldquo;Have you got tired of your
      plate?&rdquo; Disgust, relief, unsatisfied longing and a choice variety of
      unclassified emotions expressed themselves through the hasty affirmative
      of the B. M.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this chapter did not aim to treat of fishing, the writer would be
      tempted to say that Port Arthur is &ldquo;beautiful for situation.&rdquo; It lies one
      hundred and eighty miles east of Duluth on the north shore of Lake
      Superior. At this point the land rises gently from the lake shore, and
      from the elevation in the northern part of the town a beautiful panorama
      is seen. Immediately before us is Thunder Bay, hemmed in by the rocky
      walls of the mainland, Pie Island and Thunder Cape. A narrow passage opens
      out into the lake, through which Isle Royal may be dimly seen in the
      distance. Thunder Cape rises to a height of fourteen hundred feet, and Pie
      Island&mdash;which takes its name from its shape&mdash;is not less than
      one thousand feet high, with a little lake on its top. The sides of both
      island and cape are exceedingly bold. We watched them one August night as
      the setting sun touched the bold rock into gold and purple, and saw the
      shadows steal over the waters and up the precipitous sides of the cliffs
      until water and cliff were hidden in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we must get on to Nepigon, seventy-five to one hundred miles away. We
      take the train on the Canadian Pacific, and glad are we when the conductor
      shouts out, &ldquo;Nepigon.&rdquo; We look out with curious eyes upon the famous
      Canadian city. There are four log-houses, a store and a hotel. We
      afterward found the Hudson Bay Company&rsquo;s store, and the comfortable house
      occupied by the agent. In fact, this same agent was the immediate object
      of our search, for he had kindly undertaken to engage guides and make the
      other necessary arrangements for our trip up the river. He proved to be
      one of the most courteous and obliging of gentlemen, and spared no pains
      to assist us in preparations for the trip. To his wise selection of guides
      was due much of the pleasure of our outing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behold us on a sunny morning fairly embarked and headed up the noble
      Nepigon. A little geography and guide-book eloquence might be appropriate
      just here. The Nepigon River is the largest tributary to Lake Superior. It
      is about forty miles in length, and the outlet of Lake Nepigon, a body of
      water seventy miles long by fifty miles wide, with a shoreline of five
      hundred and eighty miles. There is a fall of one hundred and thirty feet
      in its course of forty miles, and that means numerous cascades and rapids.
      But the fact of prime importance is that this river is the home of big
      trout; not only large, but pugnacious. They are the Sullivans&mdash;beg
      pardon, I mean the Johnsons&mdash;of the <i>Salmo Fontinalis</i> family.
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is getting ahead of my story. We are just starting up the river.
      Let me introduce you to our four guides: Aleck De La Ronde, Joe Kejigos,
      Vincent Ashawikyegulap and Zavier Misak. They are Ojibway Indians. Aleck,
      the head man, not only speaks English, but reads and writes. Joe speaks a
      little English, and the other two none at all. Two birch-bark canoes are
      loaded with our tents, duffle and provisions. If any reader imagines that
      to camp out is to go half starved, let him cast his eye over this list of
      eatables: ham, bacon, potatoes, flour, eggs, baked beans, canned soups,
      chicken, beef, peaches, apricots, maple syrup, preserves of various kinds,
      condensed milk, bouillon, etc., etc. However, we needed all our
      provisions, and even more, for a camp appetite is sure to be large,
      vigorous, and in a chronic state of discontent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we are off. The river at this point has broadened out into a beautiful
      lake. Yonder, upon the eastern shore, nestles the Roman Catholic mission
      house. All of our guides, as well as the majority of the six hundred
      Indians upon the reservation, are members of this communion. No one who
      talks with them can doubt that their religion is real. It affects their
      lives and controls, in some measure, their actions. Yonder, toward the
      south, a great mass of red rock lifts itself high in the air, and for many
      years it gave the name of &ldquo;Red Rock&rdquo; to this section. The Indians paddle
      and jabber. It is comforting to be told by Aleck that there are no &ldquo;swear
      words&rdquo; in the Ojibway language; but for this assurance we should have
      thought our guides horribly profane. The language sounds rough and full of
      imprecation. How our conception of the morose and taciturn Indian vanishes
      in the presence of these light-hearted, genial and loquacious red-men!
      They are children, full of mirth, fond of companionship, kindly in
      disposition, honest and faithful. We pass the neat log cabins of our
      guides, catch glimpses of a few wigwams on the western shore, and by five
      o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon land at Camp Alexander, some twelve miles from
      Nepigon station. This camp is on a large pool at the foot of a rapid. The
      water comes foaming down through the narrow pass between the rocks, and
      then swirls and eddies and boils and bubbles before beginning its quiet
      journey toward the lake. It is just the place for trout. Rods are quickly
      assembled, flies carefully selected, and, trembling with eagerness, the
      fishermen make their way to the stream. And now comes a humiliating
      confession. The Preacher is the first to reach the river, and in a moment
      more his flies are dancing in the eddy. To his surprise nothing disturbs
      them. He casts again and yet again, but all in vain. So far as any signs
      of trout are concerned he might as well cast upon the pellucid waters of
      the Chicago River. Then comes a terrible temptation. A wily fiend whispers
      in his ear, &ldquo;Try a worm.&rdquo; Now the large-hearted Hudson Bay agent had
      presented the Preacher with a box of choice angle worms, and said box is
      at that moment in the ministerial pocket. Another ineffectual cast of the
      flies, and then &ldquo;What a fall was there, my countrymen!&rdquo; Off come the flies
      and on goes a fat worm. Gently the wriggling bait is dropped into the
      water, just in the shadow of a huge rock, when, tug&mdash;zip&mdash;whoop&mdash;&ldquo;Hello!
      Bring the landing net!&mdash;Quick! I&rsquo;ve got him!&mdash;Hurry up!&rdquo; The air
      is heavy with the Preacher&rsquo;s cries, and the rod is springing under the mad
      dives of the trout, and then&mdash;it is all over, and out on the grass
      lies a beautiful &ldquo;two-pounder,&rdquo; and the Preacher is suffering from the
      taunts and jeers of the Business Man and the Doctor: &ldquo;Caught it with a
      worm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of a sportsman do you call yourself?&rdquo; The pride begotten by
      capturing the first fish is knocked down and trampled upon by the shame of
      having been unsportsmanlike. Let it be said that the next day that box of
      worms was lost and never found.
    </p>
    <p>
      Back to camp, where we find the tents up and supper well under way. That
      first supper in camp! Three hungry men devoured everything in sight, until
      it came to pancakes; then they paused, not from lack of appetite, but from
      fear of a sudden and horrible death. From what ingredients Joe, the cook,
      compounded those cakes will remain a mystery forever. It was suggested
      that he had cooked a flannel blanket or a pair of gum-boots, but he denied
      it. We ate very sparingly of the cakes, and soon afterward went to bed.
      That night the Preacher had a dream. An enormous bird, with curved beak
      and fierce eyes, persisted in roosting upon his stomach. Nor would the
      bird stand still, but with fiendish malignity curvetted and danced and
      double-shuffled, greatly to the Preacher&rsquo;s discomfort. The unfortunate
      victim expostulated mildly, but the bird laughed him to scorn. Then the
      Preacher pushed the dancer off, but the bird hopped back at once and
      proceeded to execute a Highland fling. Then the long-suffering Preacher
      arose in his wrath and, seizing a knife, cut the bird&rsquo;s head off. Horror!
      No sooner was the &ldquo;foul&rdquo; deed accomplished than the bird proved to be a
      man, and the Preacher was hustled before a Chicago court to be tried for
      murder. The prosecuting attorney showed beyond a question that the
      Preacher had deliberately killed this man. The lawyer for the defence
      submitted, first, that the man had no business to assume the form of a
      bird; second, that the stomach of a Preacher should never be used as a
      dance hall. The jury retires and is gone for only five minutes. The
      Preacher trembles in the box, and as the jurymen file back into their
      seats he&mdash;awakes. The verdict will never be known, although the
      dreamer did his best to go to sleep again at once and find out the
      decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor also had his experience that first night in camp. He was shot.
      As he lay listening to the gentle breathings of his tent-mates a sharp
      report, as of a gun, was heard, and he felt a bullet strike him over the
      heart. The end had come. It was hard to die so young, far from his dear
      ones, in the depths of the wilderness; but being a good man and a
      philosopher he whispered farewell to this world, composed his limbs and
      calmly awaited death. But it didn&rsquo;t come; so the Doctor proceeded to make
      a diagnosis of his case. After thorough examination he found that the
      string stretched from the rear to the front tent pole and upon which
      various articles were suspended, had broken, and the looking-glass had
      struck him in the ribs. He took a long breath, went to sleep, and told us
      the joke in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early the next morning we broke camp and were on our way up the river. In
      order to get around the rapids a portage of two miles is made at this
      point. It was a novel sight to see our guides packing the provisions,
      cooking utensils, etc. The white guide in the Adirondacks would carry it
      in a pack basket; but the Indian makes a large bundle which he ties
      together with the ends of his packing strap&mdash;some twenty feet long&mdash;leaving
      the central and wider portion of the strap to pass over his forehead, thus
      supporting with his neck the burden which rests upon his shoulders. The
      average load for a packer is two hundred pounds. When night comes we are
      at Split Rock, where we camp, and the next day make Pine Portage. Here we
      camp for a week, and really begin to fish. There is a splendid stretch of
      broken water right in front of the camp, and good pools within a short
      distance either up or down the river. The Business Man goes down the river
      one morning and comes back with a pair of trout which weigh nine and a
      quarter pounds. Then the Doctor sets the camp in turmoil by taking a five
      and a quarter pound fish. The poor Preacher rejoices in the success of his
      brethren, and tries hard to beat them; but four and a quarter pounds is
      the best he can do. Large numbers of trout are taken, ranging from two to
      four pounds apiece, but it is the big trout we want. How swiftly the days
      pass! A week has gone, and if we are to go as far as Lake Nepigon, we must
      push on. We break camp reluctantly, for this place seems like home to us.
      We have become familiar with every rock in the stream, with every eddy,
      almost. We have watched the sun go down in the woods which stretch
      unbroken for uncounted miles to the west, and have seen the yellow moon
      lift itself above the bold shoulder of the mountain which borders the
      river on the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we have heard great stories of the fishing higher up, and away we go.
      Camp Victoria! Magic name with which to conjure scenes of the rarest
      pleasure! Here, where the swift-rushing river forms our front door-step,
      we make another long halt. Here, about ten rods below our camp, a
      gentleman from Woodstock, Ontario, took an eight-pound trout only last
      week. Here the Preacher caught three trout weighing five and a quarter,
      five, and four and a half pounds, respectively, and took two of them in
      two successive casts. Here Aleck, the head guide, broke the game law, and
      we became partakers of his crime by eating broiled partridge for supper.
      From this point we made excursions to Lake Nepigon, and found that the
      half had not been told us as to the beauties of this inland sea. Bold,
      rocky shores, clear, blue reaches of water, islands small and great,
      unbroken wilderness all about, with the August sun smiling down upon this
      unsullied work of God. A fairer picture man never saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Camp Victoria we visited Virgin Falls, where, just after the river
      leaves the lake, the water, pressed in between walls of rock, has a sheer
      fall of some twenty feet. And what noble fish we took at this camp! Great
      lusty fellows, lying in swift running water, and with every muscle
      seasoned and wiry! Poems in gold and brown they were. The rougher the
      water the larger and gamier the fish. It was here that the Doctor had had
      an attack of sea-sickness. They were out in the rapids, anchored, and the
      canoe was dancing about in the current, when the Doctor suddenly lost all
      interest in everything above his head, and fastened his gaze upon the
      bottom of the river. He heaved&mdash;well, call it a sigh; now draw the
      veil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our camp was upon the solid rock, but when the thunder-storm was abroad in
      the land, that rock shook and trembled. We shall not soon forget that
      night of storm when our tent seemed a target for the lightning. In the
      morning we found two great pines rent and shivered by the electric bolts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Indians have their own explanation of a thunder-storm. The thunder is
      the noise made by a giant bird as it beats its wings against its body; the
      lightning is caused by the bird winking its eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of those idyllic days would require a volume for its telling,
      and the patience of the reader is probably exhausted long ere this. There
      came an evening when Joe placed a dish before us and announced, &ldquo;All
      potatoes.&rdquo; To be sure they were all potatoes. Did he imagine that we would
      take them for billiard balls? But there is a deeper significance in his
      words. After a wild struggle with our language, he manages to say,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Potatoes all gone.&rdquo; This is the beginning of the end. A hasty examination
      of the larder shows us that we have barely enough provisions to last until
      we can reach civilization. It is the Business Man&rsquo;s appetite that has
      undone us. He is not large in stature, but he has developed an appetite
      that would paralyze a boarding-house keeper. The worst of it is that his
      appetite has gotten away from him, and goes roaming around among the
      victuals seeking what it may devour. Sadly we pack up and turn our faces
      toward the south. Word is brought in that Mary, the little daughter of our
      head guide, is dead. We press hurriedly on, through the sunshine and the
      beating storm, and within twenty-four hours from the time when the tidings
      reached us, our canoes are before the little cabin and we watch the
      sorrowing father as he enters his darkened home.

      Sitting on the hotel piazza at Port Arthur, the Preacher watched the
      steamer on which were the Business Man and the Doctor, until it became a
      speck on the horizon and vanished from sight. He said in his heart, &ldquo;Those
      are good men and true. Dear friends before, they are still dearer after
      the crucial test of camp life. God bless them alway.&rdquo;

    <p>
      LORIOUS Kootenay!&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what the folders call it, and if any more
      intense adjective could be found that too would be tacked on. That
      Canadian Northwest strains the English language tremendously.
      &ldquo;Magnificent,&rdquo; &ldquo;splendid,&rdquo; &ldquo;grand,&rdquo; &ldquo;glorious,&rdquo; are worn to frazzles by
      constant use, and were it possible to roll them all into one big word, it
      would still be utterly inadequate to express the native&rsquo;s admiration for
      his country. The chances are that the reader does not even know where the
      Kootenay is, and, while we have a distinct aversion to playing the part of
      a guide-book, we will go so far as to advise consultation of a good map of
      British Columbia. Down in the southeastern corner you will find Kootenay
      Lake and River, but the map does not reveal the rugged mountains, the
      wine-like air, the sparkling water, the sunshine, the peace, the
      restfulness, the TROUT that make the Kootenay one of God&rsquo;s best gifts to
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The confession may as well be made first as last that we went to the
      Kootenay country for the express purpose of fishing. This is no
      disparagement to the people or to the scenery, for each stands at the head
      of its class. But some philosopher has said (or if he has not he ought to
      have done so): &ldquo;Count that vacation wasted in which you do no fishing.&rdquo;
       Wasting a vacation is sinful; therefore we fish. Here in the Kootenay are
      trout worthy of one&rsquo;s skill; heroes of many battles; cunning and adroit
      veterans who know all the tricks at the command of the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just below the point where the Kootenay River breaks out of the lake is
      the little hamlet of Proctor. There is not much to the place but the hotel
      and the name&mdash;yes, and the trout. The river is wide and deep, with
      swift current and numberless counter-currents. Where the water rushes
      around some rock or point of sand, where current struggles with current
      and a great swirl grows out of the conflict, there the rainbow-trout hold
      their town-meetings. We attended some of them and tried our uttermost to
      break them up. It was in a visit to one of these gatherings that the
      Junior made his bow to the inhabitants of the Kootenay waters. Behold the
      young man (not quite four years old) seated in the stern of the boat, rod
      firmly grasped, determination in his eye, while his aged sire works the
      oars. To and fro over the waters for a little time, then the rod bends
      sharply back, and far behind a quivering mass of colour springs into the
      air and falls back with a mighty splash. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him!&rdquo; cries the Junior,
      and &ldquo;Hang on!&rdquo; cries the Senior. And he does hang on. Great boy, that!
      He&rsquo;s as quiet and self-controlled as if only purloining cookies out of the
      jar in the pantry. It must be confessed that the fond father gave a little
      aid in landing the victim, but what of that? A noble two-pounder is lying
      in the bottom of the boat, and if there is a prouder mortal in the
      universe than that boy it is his venerable father.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it is the house-boat concerning which we set out to write. Be it known
      that the Canadian Pacific Railway Company maintains a finely furnished
      house-boat on the Kootenay waters for such visitors as may desire to
      realize the utmost of human happiness. Can you see it in your mind&rsquo;s eye?
      Sixty feet long by about twenty in width, four staterooms with two berths
      each, servants&rsquo; quarters, kitchen, pantry, storerooms, toilets, cabin. On
      the upper deck are chairs, and here, under the shade of the awning, we
      rest after the arduous labour of doing nothing. The houseboat is towed to
      any point on river or lake which you may select, and tied up to the shore.
      The steamer stops daily on its trips from Nelson to Kootenay Landing to
      take your orders for provisions or to bring supplies. A Chinaman does the
      &ldquo;house work,&rdquo; including alleged cooking. Do you get the picture?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was five o&rsquo;clock on a Friday afternoon when the tug and the house-boat
      picked us up at Proctor. By &ldquo;us&rdquo; is meant the Preacher and his family,
      together with the Doctor and his daughter. The wind was blowing fresh from
      the south, and our destination was twenty miles away. Once out of the
      river where the wind could get a fair chance at us, and that house-boat
      began to buck. Perhaps you think there are no possibilities of a heavy sea
      on an inland lake. If so, you will do well to think again. Kootenay Lake
      is more than one hundred miles long with an average width of some five
      miles. Great mountains guard it on either side, and up that long tunnel
      the wind came with a whoop. The boat was lashed to the windward side of
      the tug, and so was in position to get the full benefit of any slap that
      the waves thought best to give. We rose and fell and heaved about. The
      hawsers were not absolutely taut, and ever and again the boat would be
      knocked against the tug with a jar that made everything rattle. It was
      time for supper, and the potatoes were on to boil and the tea-kettle was
      just beginning to sing, when a huge wave lifted us up and hurled us
      against the tug. Over went potatoes, tea-kettle, kerosene can and
      everything else that was not nailed down, while the dishes flew from their
      resting-places and smashed to pieces on the floor. Who cares? Certain
      members of the party did not, at any rate, for they had lost all interest
      in the food supply, and were in retirement. Huge joke, to be sea-sick on a
      house-boat! The captain yells from the tug that we must abandon the
      thought of making Midge Creek that night, and heads for Pilot Bay, across
      the lake. Blessed haven! In a landlocked harbour anchor is dropped and in
      a short time order is brought out of chaos, and the discouraged members of
      the party regain their appetites.
    </p>
    <p>
      At four o&rsquo;clock the next morning we are awakened by the chugging of the
      tug. Day is just breaking, and the lake is as smooth as the floor of a
      bowling alley. Three hours later we are tied up to a sandy beach on the
      west shore of the lake, and vacation has really begun. Not a house is to
      be seen except two or three in the distance on the opposite shore. Ten
      rods away, to the north, a mountain stream comes rushing down the canyon
      and goes billowing far out into the lake. At the south end of the beach a
      giant mass of bare rock lifts itself into the air, while the mountains are
      all about us. Here and there a snowy peak looms into the blue. The lake
      dimples and smiles under a cloudless sky, and murmurs a gentle welcome as
      it laps upon the gravelly beach. This is a beautiful world, and nowhere
      more beautiful than on the shores of the Kootenay.

    </h5>
    <p>
      What about the fishing? In view of the dictum recently rendered by certain
      inordinately good people and recorded in one of our great religious
      weeklies, that question is clearly out of order. It has been decided by
      those who have no question as to their infallibility that it is wicked to
      catch fish. (Poor Peter! How thoroughly ashamed of himself he would be
      were he living in this day of ethical enlightenment.) Let it be understood
      before proceeding further, that our action has historic precedent in the
      well-known case of the boy and the woodchuck. We had to fish. We were
      forty miles from the base of supplies. The Doctor and the Junior and the
      girls and the head of the house and the Chinaman and the Preacher must eat
      or perish. As each and all manifested a strong prejudice against
      perishing, some one must fish. The Preacher offers himself as a hesitating
      violator of that high-toned, transcendental morality which places fishing
      among the mortal sins, and the Doctor aids and abets him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just here listen to a word of advice: If you will fish, provide yourself
      with a friend so unselfish that he will joyously perjure himself by
      declaring that he does not care anything about the sport and prefers to
      row the boat. It is important to have good tackle, carefully selected
      flies, a rod that will stand strain and a line that runs freely; but the
      <i>sine qua non</i> is a companion whose generosity is so much greater
      than your own that he will insist upon turning himself into a motor for
      your benefit. Such a man is the Doctor. May all blessings rest upon him!
      Those golden hours on the Kootenay were enriched by his companionship, and
      his unselfishness materially increased the Preacher&rsquo;s score.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we are off. The trunks have been unpacked, the &ldquo;girls&rdquo; are tidying up
      the boat, the Junior is busy floating his ships from the shore, and the
      row-boat, with the Doctor at the oars and the Preacher waving his rod, is
      rounding the point of rocks to the south. Repeated casts of the flies find
      nothing doing. At last there is a swirl and a tug. But what sort of a
      trout is it at the end of the line? He pulls and plunges, but there is
      never a jump nor any indication of a purpose to break water. It is not
      much of a fight, anyhow, and the net lifts in a fish the like of which
      neither Doctor nor Preacher has ever seen before. Large head, enormous
      mouth, brownish back and sides with yellowish belly, he looks something
      like a salt water ling. And that was the sum total of the morning&rsquo;s catch.
      Not much slaughter of the innocents about that! We ventured to cook that
      unclassified victim, and he was not bad as food for the starving. Later on
      the Doctor learned from the hermit&mdash;of course we had a hermit&mdash;that
      the stranger is called a &ldquo;squaw-fish,&rdquo; although it is said that the proper
      name is &ldquo;squawk-fish,&rdquo; so called from the noise it makes when caught.

      Is this all that the far-famed Kootenay can furnish? Must it be told to
      future generations that two able-bodied men spent a half-day of strenuous
      toil and only captured a plebeian squaw-fish? Well, tell it if you must,
      but when you get started keep right on and tell the whole story. That
      afternoon we deserted the calm water along the shore and struck out for
      the tumbling billows made by Midge Creek as it rushes into the lake. Then
      and there the sport began. The trout were at home and receiving callers.
      The gaudy &ldquo;Parmachene Belle&rdquo; had no sooner struck the water than snap&mdash;whizz&mdash;jump&mdash;splash&mdash;landing
      net&mdash;two-pounder, and then it all began over again. We had struck our
      gait.
    </p>
    <p>
      What fishing! Did you ever catch a rainbow trout? If not, you have yet to
      live. He is a combination of gymnast and dynamo. When communications have
      been established, he at once begins a series of acrobatic performances
      which leave no doubt as to his agility. The writer counted twelve jumps
      made by one fish before he was brought to net. These were not little
      disturbances of the surface of the water, just enough to give notice of
      his whereabouts&mdash;but clean leaps. How high? How would three feet do?
      If that&rsquo;s too much, take off an inch. Especially fascinating was the sport
      after sundown, when the dusk was upon the face of the waters. Then, with a
      &ldquo;white miller&rdquo; as lure, we circled the broken water, knowing not where the
      fly lighted, but certain that it would be seen and craved by some hungry
      trout.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was in the early morning that the most wonderful phenomena were
      seen. The writer pledges his word that if he had not been there he would
      not believe it (the reader is not expected to credit the statement), but
      the Preacher, on divers and sundry occasions, left his berth before
      sunrise and went out to fish. The grey is in the eastern sky, and the lake
      motionless. Nothing breaks the silence but the roar of the creek or the
      sharp challenge of a chipmunk. Rowing slowly along the shore, the world
      seems as fresh as if newly born. A tip-up teeters along the beach, a
      thrush sings his morning hymn of praise among the trees on the mountain
      side, and now the sun peeps over a notch in the eastern hills. Did you
      ever see more exquisite colouring than the brown of the moss upon that
      rock, or the delicate shades of green in that clump of trees? The fish are
      not early risers, or, if they are up, have not found their appetites: but
      what matters it? Here are peace and beauty; God&rsquo;s good world at its best.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just one little story about the big trout. It was close by a face of rock
      that rose sheer from the water for fifty feet or more, that we struck him.
      Up and again up, in mighty leaps clear from the water he flung himself.
      With great surges he carried out the line, and then allowed himself to be
      coaxed gently toward the boat. When the Preacher fancied that the fight
      was well over and the great fish could be seen plainly but a few feet from
      the boat, there was another rush, and this straight down. There were one
      hundred and fifty feet of line on the reel, and the old warrior took out
      every inch of it. Where did he go? To China for aught the writer knows&mdash;but
      he came back. Slowly and reluctantly he yielded to the steady strain, and
      at last lay in the bottom of the boat, a dream of beauty. Three pounds and
      a quarter! The biggest rainbow trout caught in the Kootenay this summer;
      so the Nelson fishermen aver! Hooray!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time, the members of the gentler sex are saying, &ldquo;It must have
      been deadly dull for the &lsquo;girls.&rsquo;&rdquo; Far from it. Ask the Preacheress, and
      she will tell you that every moment of every day was full of happiness.
      That you may have a glimpse at some of the experiences which helped to
      make the hours pass pleasantly, listen to the tale of the chipmunks. The
      whole family looked at us askance when we first tied up near their home.
      Just a hurried scamper along the logs, and then away they fled with a
      warning chatter. Two days had not passed before they were eating crumbs
      thrown out for them. On the third day their suspicions were so far allayed
      that they ate from the hand of one of the party. After that, not a day
      passed, and hardly an hour of daylight, but some one could be seen holding
      out a crust at which a chipmunk was gnawing away. They lost all fear and
      would crawl over the knees and sometimes up on the shoulders in search of
      rations. They would allow us to stroke their heads and feel of the
      cheek-pouches in which they stored away food, without raising the
      slightest objections. When we left they had come to seem like old friends.
      They deserved better treatment at our hands than was accorded them, and
      the writer&rsquo;s heart is filled with self-reproach as he recalls the
      dastardly act with which we closed our relations with these little
      friends. We gave them Jimmie&rsquo;s pie! (Jimmie was the Chinese cook.) Near
      the close of our stay he manufactured the most wonderful and in every way
      impossible pie ever achieved by human ingenuity. One after another, every
      member of the party attacked that combination, only to suffer defeat. It
      was still intact when the time came to leave. It would have had abiding
      interest as a specimen, but there was danger that it might be broken in
      transit, so we left it for those confiding chipmunks. One thing is sure,
      if living, they must be woefully discouraged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie was a character. What he did not know about the English language
      was equalled only by his abysmal ignorance of cooking. Asked to bring some
      breakfast-food for the Junior, he disappeared kitchenward, and when, after
      a long absence, one of the party went in search of him, he was discovered
      proudly bearing toward the table&mdash;a canteloupe. But Jimmie did his
      best, and that was quite enough to satisfy the happy members of our little
      family. He could boil potatoes well, and the water that he brought from
      Midge Creek was always first-class. Then, too, we had cooks of our own.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time to stop,&rdquo; do I hear the weary reader say? Very likely, but the half
      has not been told. You should hear about the &ldquo;hermit,&rdquo; with his long,
      white hair and beard, his piercing eyes, his little shack and garden and
      the romantic love-affair which is said to have driven him into voluntary
      exile. You have not heard of the hard tramp up the canyon, past almost
      innumerable cascades and rapids, back and upwards until a pool is reached
      where a great throng of mountain trout is assembled. That marvellous
      rainbow which followed the Sunday afternoon storm must be ignored. The
      Junior&rsquo;s sand-wells, his fall from the gang-plank resulting in a broken
      collar-bone, the fracas with a colony of yellow-jackets, the night of
      storm when we feared lest the cables break and we go drifting at the mercy
      of wind and waves&mdash;but what&rsquo;s the use? You will never know what you
      have missed through your insistence that you&rsquo;ve had enough. The writer had
      intended to tell of the total depravity of those trout, manifested on the
      Sundays of our stay with them, as they gathered <i>en masse</i> at the
      stern of the house-boat and dared the Preacher to cast a fly. Perhaps it
      is just as well to stop right here, for words cannot be found with which
      to describe the ministerial struggle.

      HAT&rsquo;S that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The elect lady should have been asleep instead of sitting up in bed, an
      animated interrogation point, for the hour was late and the ride from
      Chicago that day had been hot and dusty and fatiguing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s what?&rdquo; grunted the sleepy partner of her joys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That noise. Don&rsquo;t you hear it? It sounds like a band playing in the
      distance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When this suggestion finally penetrated the semiconscious mind of the
      husband, the absurdity of the idea called forth certain emphatic if not
      convincing negative arguments, all of which were met with the puzzling
      query, &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s not a band, what is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll soon find out,&rdquo; answered the skeptic, as he arose to
      begin a serious investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise was unmistakable; faint but clear, and from without. Approaching
      the window the noise became more distinct, but the character of it
      remained a mystery. Bands are not indigenous in rural districts, and no
      large town was near. With nose pressed against the window-screen in a vain
      effort to see everything within a radius of five miles, the explorer
      suddenly realized that the music was right at hand, and the musicians, in
      countless numbers, were separated from his face only by the wire netting.
      Mosquitoes? Exactly, and their name was legion. If night had suddenly
      turned to day one could not have seen anything through that window for the
      cloud of mosquitoes. New Jersey may justly boast of the size and ferocity
      of her mosquitoes, but for numbers Skegemog fears no rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is more than probable that some reader will say to himself, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t
      stay in such a place.&rdquo; Well, we stayed, not because of the pests, but in
      spite of them, and because they formed the only drawback to one&rsquo;s
      enjoyment. The Lodge was on a point of land with water on three sides, the
      table was exceptionally satisfactory, the guests were congenial and the
      black bass never failed to respond promptly to our advances. What are a
      few mosquitoes, more or less, when such paradisaical conditions obtain?
    </p>
    <p>
      To many people a bass is a bass, and that&rsquo;s all there is to it. To be
      sure, they recognize the fact that some bass are larger than others, but
      the process of differentiation begins and ends with the table of weights
      and measures. Skegemog bass belong to the small-mouth family, and there is
      as much difference between these and the big-mouth variety as between a
      split-bamboo rod and a saw-log. The small-mouth is the aristocrat of the
      bass family. He is more dainty in his tastes, more plucky, and has more
      brains than his brother of the more generous facial opening.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the small-mouth bass are not all alike. The marked differences seen in
      children of the same family are duplicated in the individuality shown by
      fish belonging to the same species. The bass whose home is in swift waters
      is a stronger, more tireless fighter than his brother of the lake. Of two
      bass living side by side in the same water, one may be logy and lazy and
      indisposed to strenuous exertion when hooked, while the other is brought
      to net only after he has tried every dodge known to fishdom and exhausted
      every atom of his strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was while fishing on the reef just west of the Point that the invalid
      bass was taken. Each fisherman has his favourite method of capturing bass.
      One uses live frogs and casts close to the edge of the rushes or weeds
      along shore. Another trolls with many yards of line out, and a piece of
      pork-rind or a minnow fastened to the spoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still a third anchors his boat and still-fishes with live minnows. A
      fourth method, and one which we prefer to any of the others, is to row
      slowly over promising ground, letting the minnow sink well down and
      keeping it constantly moving. It was while fishing in this manner and
      after taking six or eight fine fish, that a feeble tug at the line
      signalled the presence of the invalid. He came in with scarce a struggle;
      in fact he seemed to be relieved to have his troubles ended. As no expert
      was present to diagnose the case we shall never know from what malady he
      suffered, but he was a sick fish. If he had been a man the pallor and
      emaciation might have indicated tuberculosis, although he did not cough.
      He had a giant frame, and in health would have weighed five pounds or
      more. As it was, he barely went two pounds. As he was still able to wiggle
      a little after the weighing process was over, he was returned to the
      water, where, after lying seemingly lifeless for a moment, he feebly swam
      away. Just before he disappeared he turned a reproachful look towards the
      fisherman, as much as to say, &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you put an end to my suffering?
      I&rsquo;m disappointed in you.&rdquo; If we ever catch another invalid fish we&rsquo;ll kill
      him on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      On a certain day, among the new arrivals was a Cleric and his Satellite.
      The Cleric was a genial and interesting man and an enthusiastic fisherman.
      That night he asked many questions about the fishing, and calmly announced
      that the next day he would show us how to catch bass. Then the Satellite
      took the floor and descanted at length upon the prowess of his friend and
      the piscatorial victories won by him on other waters and in other days.
      Not a word was said in reply by the men of the company, some of whom had
      fancied that they knew a little about bass fishing; but on more than one
      face there was a grim look which betokened something a little short of
      perfect happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the Cleric and his Satellite were up bright and early,
      being the first to start out upon the day&rsquo;s fishing. Later on, three other
      boats put out, each containing a man who had vowed to beat that Cleric or
      perish in the attempt. When night came and the records of the day&rsquo;s
      catches were compared, it was found that the high-hook had brought in
      eighteen bass, another twelve, a third eight, while the invincible Cleric
      had taken but two. Never again, as the guests gathered on the porch at
      nightfall, did the Cleric expatiate upon his skill as a fisher for bass,
      and no more did the Satellite recount the marvellous exploits of his hero.
      On the faces of the other fishermen there rested a look of deep
      satisfaction and in their eyes one might detect a gleam of amusement. It
      isn&rsquo;t necessary to brag about your achievements. Just do things, and let
      that brag for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the Cleric was a good fellow and his stories helped to pass many an
      evening pleasantly. One, that may serve as a sample, has stuck in our
      memory:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where a railroad crosses a Michigan river is a deep pool under the
      bridge. As a fisherman was casting in this pool one day, he had a mighty
      strike followed by the fierce whizzing of his reel as the fish ran out the
      line. Before the man realized what was happening the line parted and the
      fish was free. In the afternoon he returned with a new and stronger line,
      only to repeat the experience of the morning. Then salmon tackle was
      called into use, which was promptly smashed by the, as yet, unseen denizen
      of the pool. By this time the fisherman had parted company with all his
      cherished principles of sportsmanship, and vowed that he would capture
      that fish even if he had to shoot it. Abjuring the rod, he next employed a
      muskallonge line and a cod-hook, baiting with a five-inch minnow. The fish
      responded promptly, and the big line just as promptly parted when this
      Sandow of the finny tribe had gotten fully into action. As a result of
      deep reflection the fisherman then bought a clothes-line and employed a
      neighbouring blacksmith to make him a hook big enough and strong enough to
      hold a shark. Baiting the hook with a pound of raw beef and giving the
      line a half-hitch around a near-by stump, he once more challenged his
      unseen foe. For three hours a mighty battle raged. The blacksmith, two
      section hands and a farmer joined forces with the fisherman, and the five
      of them finally succeeded in landing the fish. After quieting him with a
      club, they began to wonder at the fight which he had put up. While he was
      large&mdash;some twenty-five inches in length&mdash;his size did not fully
      explain matters. Then one of them undertook to turn the fish over with his
      foot, and could not stir him. He used both hands and failed. Then the five
      together tackled the job and barely succeeded. Evidently, here was an
      extraordinarily heavy fish, and the phenomenon was explained only when
      they cut the fish open and found him full of <i>railroad frogs</i>.&rdquo; That
      story brings to mind the champion storyteller of northern Michigan who
      acted as occasional oarsman for the Skegemog guests. He was generally
      known as the &ldquo;Cheerful Liar,&rdquo; and his kinship to Baron Munchausen was put
      beyond the shadow of a doubt by the variety and character of his stories.
      After a somewhat careful study of the man, at least one of his occasional
      companions became convinced that he did not prevaricate consciously. His
      was simply a case of an over-grown and exuberant imagination. Given a tiny
      bit of fact as a starter, that imagination began to caper about without
      let or hindrance until the most incredible story resulted. He was a great
      comrade, always good-natured, always personally interested in the fishing,
      a lover of the woods and the water, ready at all times with an interesting
      story and never telling the same one twice. What more can one reasonably
      ask in an oarsman?
    </p>
    <p>
      In earlier days he had lived in another part of the state, and most of his
      alleged adventures were localized on or near Clearwater Lake. As
      accurately as we could compute, the fish which he claimed to have caught
      in this one lake would have been sufficient to cover the southern
      peninsula of Michigan to a depth of seventeen feet, six inches, and then
      leave some four hundred fish unused. One of the most fascinating of his
      many delightful yarns concerned his adventure with a giant pickerel:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Jim Smith and I,&rdquo; the narrator began, &ldquo;were fishin&rsquo; one lowery day
      on Clearwater Lake in a cranky little boat, when Jim hooked on to a
      pick&rsquo;rel. The fish put up a tough fight and Jim got excited and kept
      standin&rsquo; up in the boat and I a-yellin&rsquo; to him to se&rsquo;down. Bimeby Jim got
      &lsquo;im into the boat, and then jumped up again, and over we went. When I saw
      we were goin&rsquo; I grabbed for the line and got holt just above the spoon.
      That pick&rsquo;rel pulled and I hung on and he took me clear to the bottom in
      eighteen foot of water. When we got down there, I grabbed that fish with
      both hands, tucked him under my left arm, gave a big spring and shot up to
      the top of the water. What does that pick&rsquo;rel do as soon as we reached the
      top, but slip out from under my arm and make for the bottom again, me
      hangin&rsquo; on to the line close to the spoon. When we reached the bottom I
      tucked him under my arm again, gave another spring, came to the top; the
      fish squirmed out again, and&mdash;well, I don&rsquo;t know how many times we
      made the trip up and back, but just when I was about tuckered, some
      fellows in another boat came up and pulled us both in. That pick&rsquo;rel
      weighed twenty-two pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thoughtful critic will easily separate the element of historic fact
      from the mythical accretions in this story, and be able to retain Jim and
      a fishing trip and a big &ldquo;pick&rsquo;rel,&rdquo; even if compelled to reject the
      account of the numerous subaqueous excursions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In many of the larger inland lakes of Michigan lake-trout may be found,
      and summer visitors vary the sport of bass fishing with excursions after
      trout. Early in the season these fish are found in shallow water, along
      the shore, and may be taken by ordinary trolling; but as the weather grows
      warm the trout retreat to the deepest part of the lake, where they can be
      captured only by some unusual means. The method employed does not appeal
      strongly to a true sportsman, but he can afford to try it, once, at least,
      for the sake of the novelty. At the foot of Elk Lake lived an old man who
      was a past-master in the art of taking these deep-lying trout, and to him
      the visitor turned when he grew satiated with bass fishing and sighed for
      new worlds to conquer. The old fisherman has a big, heavy boat, in the
      back end of which he has fixed a windlass holding a thousand feet of fine,
      copper wire. The trout are lying in about three hundred feet of water, and
      no ordinary line will allow the trolling spoon to sink deep enough to
      reach those dim recesses. With all the copper wire paid out, the old man
      rows slowly over the deepest parts of the lake, while the tourist sits
      holding the handle of the windlass, ready to begin turning at the least
      suspicion of a strike. Now and then there is a false alarm, and the
      excited fisherman cranks in a thousand feet of wire only to find a piece
      of wood or weed fastened to the spoon-hook. When, by chance, a trout is
      hooked, the sensation differs little from that experienced in winding up a
      bucket of water from a deep well. The fish has not travelled far in his
      involuntary journey through the water before he loses all ambition, fills
      with water and becomes no more obstreperous than any other inanimate
      object would be when fastened to sixty rods of line. These trout are
      delicious eating, and run as high as twenty-five pounds, or even more in
      weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other trout, the real, speckled brook-trout, are found in the streams
      flowing into the lake, and more than one delightful day was spent in
      pursuit of them. After all, there is no other fishing quite like that. It
      is not altogether because brook-trout are the cleanliest, handsomest of
      fish, or that they are so gamey and so toothsome that this sport is easily
      the prime favourite with fishermen. The brook itself is a joy. Just to
      company with it makes life worth while. It chatters to you, laughs at you,
      plays hide-and-go-seek with you, and never gets to be an old story.
      Sitting on an old root, just where a log fallen across the stream makes a
      good hiding-place for the shy fish, it doesn&rsquo;t matter very much whether
      you catch anything or not. The checkers of sunlight are dancing all about
      you, a red squirrel is scolding at you from a neighbouring tree, a mink
      may go stealing by if you are quiet, and over all is a great peace which
      steals into the heart, filling it with profound contentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day we followed far up the brook, so far that when the night fell and
      we saw a farmer&rsquo;s home across the fields, it was deemed wise to seek
      lodging there for the night rather than to attempt the long trip back to
      the Point through the darkness. The farmer and his wife were hospitable
      and kindly, furnished us with an appetizing supper and, later on, showed
      us to a tiny bed-room under the eaves. It was not the fault of the
      house-wife, for the buildings were old, but a brief stay in that bed
      proved beyond peradventure that it had been preëmpted. We did not &ldquo;fight
      and run away&rdquo;; we ran without even beginning to fight. Stealing quietly
      down stairs we made for the neighbouring barn and the haymow, where we
      slept untroubled by anything more vicious than an occasional
      &ldquo;daddy-long-legs.&rdquo; Then, in the early-morning, back to the brook again and
      to trout that fairly tumbled over one another in their eagerness to grab
      the &ldquo;Silver Doctor&rdquo; as the light rod sent it flitting to and fro over the
      face of the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      When one of the guests proposed, one evening, that we all go on an
      excursion up the lakes the next day, there was hearty and unanimous
      assent. The lakes that wash the shores of Skegemog Point are only two of a
      series, all connected by thoroughfares. A steamer of light draught can go
      the whole length of the chain, some twenty-five miles or more. The next
      morning proved ideal for such a trip. The sky was a deep blue with just
      enough fleecy clouds in it to furnish the needed contrast. The wind set
      little wavelets to dancing on every inch of the lake, but never grew
      troublesome and unpleasant. The farmers were at work in their grain fields
      on either shore, the luncheon was excellent, and nothing occurred to mar
      the pleasure of the day. Why write of an experience so common and so
      uneventful? Just because of what the day brought to one member of the
      little company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the excursionists was a man in middle life whose mother had gone
      home to God the previous Christmas-time. He had seen the light go out of
      her eyes, had held her hand in his as she breathed her last, had stood by
      the new-made grave in the village cemetery as they lowered the casket into
      the earth. The snow lay deep upon the ground and was steadily falling as
      the friends turned away from the burial and, Christian man though he was,
      that son could not feel that his mother was. Have you ever felt that one
      who has been a part of your life, is not only dead, but has utterly and
      entirely ceased to be? He told himself that she whom he had loved so
      passionately was safe in our Father&rsquo;s house, and he believed it&mdash;but
      he could not feel it. The days and weeks and months had come and gone, and
      still there had come to his heart&mdash;whatever his head might affirm&mdash;no
      comforting sense that his mother still lived, safe-sheltered in a better
      country. He was sitting by himself that day, far up in the bow of the
      boat, drinking in the beauty of earth and sky and lake. It all brought
      back other and golden days when he and his mother had been together on the
      majestic St. Lawrence, and then, all at once&mdash;<i>She</i> was at hand.
      He felt her presence like a benediction. He heard no voice, saw no vision;
      but somehow his soul sensed her nearness, and his sore heart knew a
      comfort that has never departed and never lessened in the years that have
      come and gone since that hour.

    <p>
      AVE you ever taken the Georgian Bay trip?&rdquo; asked the General Passenger
      Agent when we sought his advice as to our annual outing. &ldquo;The scenery is
      beautiful and the fishing all that heart could wish.&rdquo; So it came to pass
      that we boarded the steamer at Sault Ste. Marie for the round trip of
      Georgian Bay, our tickets including generous stop-over privileges.
      Undoubtedly &ldquo;palatial&rdquo; is the proper term to use in describing a passenger
      steamer, but having never lived in a palace we are unable to judge of the
      fitness of the appellation as applied to this particular boat. We can
      affirm, however, that we were very comfortable, and that the scenery quite
      equalled our high expectations. So many people have made this trip and it
      has been described so frequently and so well, that the eulogistic
      possibilities of the English language were long ago exhausted in praise of
      the beauty of this unsalted sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be enough to say that we made the regulation trip and were quite
      orthodox in the matter of admiration. The moments of enthusiasm over the
      scenery were interspersed with periods of deep reflection; for somewhere
      along the course of the steamer we had decided to stop off for a stay of
      some weeks. Where should it be? We had started with a notion that the
      choice would lie between Pantanguishene and Parry Sound; but the former
      place failed to make a strong appeal, and at Parry Sound there were too
      many people and too few fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      On our way down we had touched at Manitowaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      When and where had we heard of this place? Carefully overhauling the odds
      and ends stowed away in the chambers of memory, we came at last upon a
      glowing account, given us some years before by a fisherman friend, of a
      vacation spent at Manitowaning. Much of what he said had been forgotten,
      but not his praise of the fishing. When the captain of the steamer assured
      us that there was a comfortable hotel in the little village, the matter
      was settled, and Manitowaning it was. It may be just as well to exhibit
      the &ldquo;fly in the ointment&rdquo; at once, and have done with it. The hotel had a
      bar, and the drinking and the drunkenness went far towards marring our
      enjoyment of this otherwise most delightful spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manitou Lake, three miles from the village, swarms with little-mouth bass.
      One can hire a rig for a dollar and a half for the day, and many were the
      hours spent in close and delightful intercourse with the inhabitants of
      this beautiful body of water. Bass are freaky fish, and one never knows
      just when they will take a notion to scorn all efforts at their capture.
      One day Sue and the writer drove over to the lake, and those bass took
      everything that was offered. In a little sandy bay, where the water was
      not over four feet deep, we anchored and began fishing with minnows. So
      eager were the fish that both of us were kept busy hauling in the victims
      and putting on fresh bait. The Senior decided to try a gaudy, artificial
      fly, and the bass grabbed it with utter disregard of the fact that it
      resembled nothing which they had ever seen before. The fishing went
      forward so fast and furiously that it was finally agreed to throw back
      every bass that was not clearly of three pounds in weight, or more. Urged
      on by the sport of that day, the whole family started bright and early the
      next morning to duplicate the delightful experience. Alas! some mysterious
      change had come over the &ldquo;spirit of their dream&rdquo; in fishdom. Not a bass
      could be found in the little sandy bay where they had thronged only a
      short twenty-four hours before and, after a day of arduous toil, the net
      results were five bass, not one over two pounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the fisherman were to find an earthly paradise it would be where he
      could catch trout from one side of his boat and little-mouth bass from the
      other. Next in attractiveness to this unrealized ideal must be placed the
      spot where these two species of game fish may both be found within a
      radius of a few miles. In this respect Manitowaning fills the bill.
      Although the village is on an island&mdash;Grand Manitoulin&mdash;trout
      streams abound, and among these the one flowing out of Manitou Lake was
      highly recommended by local sportsmen. The favourite point was some
      fifteen miles distant, and we were advised to drive over in the afternoon,
      stay all night at a farmer&rsquo;s nearby, getting the evening and morning
      fishing. That sounded attractive, and was promptly tried out. There may be
      lazier horses than the one we drove that day, but if so they should be
      promptly executed for the crime of putting an unendurable strain on the
      driver&rsquo;s good nature. But we finally arrived at our destination, and could
      hardly wait to stable Bucephalus, so eager were we to begin operations
      with the trout. It was a sizable stream, with much quick water in sight as
      we crossed the bridge and, in anticipation, we saw the big string of noble
      fish that we would carry proudly back to Manitowaning on the morrow. Must
      it be told? When it was nine o&rsquo;clock that night and too dark to
      distinguish a favourable pool from a mud-puddle, we turned towards the
      farm-house not only without a trout, but not having had one rise in
      response to the incalculable number of times that the alluring flies had
      been cast. The next morning, at sunrise, we were on the stream again, and
      four hours of faithful fishing brought in return two small trout which had
      evidently escaped from some asylum for feeble-minded fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      On our way out we had noticed an attractive looking stream which we
      crossed some ten miles from Manitowaning. Just by the bridge over this
      stream stood the remains of an old mill, half fallen down and with the
      timbers of the dam furnishing ideal hiding places for trout. When this
      spot was reached on the return trip the pull was too strong to be resisted
      and, hitching the apology for a horse to a nearby fence, preparations were
      made for a foray upon the unsuspecting fish. Fly-casting was out of the
      question and, after choosing a new snood of double gut and covering the
      hook with an exceedingly plethoric angleworm, the bait was cautiously
      dropped into the rushing waters at the upper side of the ruins of the
      flume. Slowly the line was paid out and the lure allowed to go far down
      out of sight. Zip! Yank! Tug!&mdash;and it&rsquo;s all over. Under the
      conditions, any such thing as playing the fish was out of the question,
      and the straight-away pull parted that new snood as if it had been made of
      a single strand of cotton thread. Our humiliation was complete, and with a
      thoroughly chastened spirit the horse was untied and the homeward journey
      resumed. That night as we told the champion fisherman of the village of
      the experience at the old mill, he poured a little balm upon our sore
      spirit by exclaiming, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s no trout, that&rsquo;s a whale. There isn&rsquo;t a
      fisherman within twenty-five miles of the old mill who has not hooked that
      fish and lost him.&rdquo; Strange, isn&rsquo;t it, how other men&rsquo;s ill fortune takes
      some measure of the sting from our own?
    </p>
    <p>
      But this is no tale of woe. On another day, and on the same stream that
      flows by the old mill, the elect-lady and her unworthy consort spent hours
      that are a joy to recall. It was only eleven miles to the point
      recommended by our friendly adviser, and the horse was reasonably
      ambitious. We had laid in a supply of provisions and took along a skillet.
      A perfect day and perfect comradeship, plenty to eat and the novelty of
      unexplored territory, made it certain that, fish or no fish, the hours
      would pass pleasantly. As so frequently happens when we are not very
      particular whether the fish bite or not, they elected to be friendly. The
      stream where we visited it ran through meadow and pasture-land, with a
      luxuriant growth of alders along its banks. The open spaces afforded
      opportunities for my lady to try her hand at trout fishing, and the other
      member of the party could wade the stream and test the more inaccessible
      places. The water was almost ice-cold, the stream having its rise less
      than a mile away in a great, bubbling spring. Owing to the colour of the
      water the stream is called the &ldquo;Bluejay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When noon came, a fire was kindled in a secluded spot close by the running
      brook. Coffee! You never tasted any like it. Fried trout! Why are they
      never so appetizing as when cooked and eaten in the open? We lingered long
      over that dinner, and the writer would fain linger a little over that day
      even now when it is only a memory. He has known many happy days; days
      which are golden as he looks back upon them across the years; but among
      them all no day spent in the out-of-doors, in touch with fields and stream
      and sky, stands out more clearly and alluringly against the background of
      yesterday than that passed with the dearest woman in the world upon the
      banks of the Bluejay. The sun was low in the west as we started homeward,
      and from the summit of a low hill over which the road led, we looked north
      and eastward over miles of woodland and cultivated fields, and saw in the
      distance the glistening waters of the bay. Yes, there is the lighthouse at
      Manito-waning, and the children are watching for us. In spite of the
      alluring beauty of the scene, something more attractive awaits us yonder.
      We must hasten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before leaving home it had been decided that all but one member of the
      family should spend a portion of the vacation time in visiting old
      friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, when Sault Ste. Marie was reached, the devotee of rod and
      reel turned his face towards the north, while the wife and children took
      steamer for Chicago. The trip into the woods was not undertaken alone, for
      a fisherman friend who shall be known as Jim, one of the best of comrades,
      was waiting at the Canadian &ldquo;Soo&rdquo; to bear us company on the visit to the
      Algoma woods. What name, if any, the railroad bears which runs from the
      &ldquo;Soo&rdquo; sixty miles northeast, we do not know. The company does not depend
      upon passenger traffic for revenue, for that would mean bankruptcy. The
      road is used for hauling out logs, with the suggestion now and then made
      that some day it will be extended to Hudson&rsquo;s Bay. The day before we were
      to go up the line, a trestle had been partially burned, and the train
      crept fearfully over the half-repaired structure. We were probably some
      five or six hours running the sixty miles which brought us to Trout Lake
      and the shack where we were to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the kind offices of the Superintendent of the Algoma Railroad we
      had been able to secure accommodations with a forest ranger, who had a
      comfortable cabin and was an excellent cook. It was the only building for
      many miles around, and Edwards, the ranger, must know some lonely hours,
      especially during the long winters. Lest others may share the delusion of
      a friend who said that he wondered we did not starve at such a long
      distance from market, listen to the bill of fare: plenty of good bread and
      butter, eggs, bacon, toast, trout, with blueberries and raspberries <i>ad
      libitum</i>. Less than eighty rods away was a lumber camp where we could
      get milk and cream, and in return for trout the cook kept us supplied with
      delicious blueberry pies. The man who is on friendly terms with the cook
      for a logging camp need never suffer from hunger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first night after our arrival we were awakened by a knocking at the
      door. Upon being admitted the visitor told of a sick child which had been
      brought up from the city in hopes that the change might prove beneficial.
      The mother and child were living in a tent and they feared the little one
      was dying. Had we any medicine? We had, and he departed with it. The next
      morning the baby was reported as being better, and the following Sunday
      when we were invited to dinner at the logging camp, the mother and child
      were at table with us. When we saw that mother feeding baked beans, boiled
      ham, pickles and pie, to a child that had recently been at the point of
      death with cholera infantum, we had an unexpressed conviction that it
      would take something more than cholera-mixture to save the child this
      time. However, so far as we could learn, the little one survived in spite
      of its mother&rsquo;s folly. Possibly ham and pie are specifics in this disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      The country here is broken, rocky hills of considerable size almost
      surrounding the lake. Neighbouring lakes are to be found in nearly every
      direction, one of them less than half a mile away. From these lakes trout
      of large size may be taken, but not with the fly; at least at the time of
      year when we visited them. They seemed lazy and somewhat indifferent even
      to the minnows offered them. Now and then one would deign to respond to
      our invitations, but it was never with any enthusiasm. It will always
      remain an open question whether the huge trout that coquetted with Jim&rsquo;s
      hook, one day, was a reality or a phantom. We were on a lake some three
      miles from camp and had taken a few fish. Fishing in some fifteen feet of
      water, Jim had a strike and brought a big fish so near to the surface that
      he was plainly seen by the three of us, and then the exasperating rascal
      quietly sank down out of sight. The bait was immediately lowered and a
      prompt response secured in the shape of another strike. Again the trout
      came within clear view, and again, without any apparent haste,
      disappeared. How many times this was repeated deponent saith not; but the
      repetition of this ungracious performance went on until even Jim&rsquo;s
      patience was exhausted and we went on our way.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on this lake, near the outlet, that we came upon a beaver-house,
      recently built. We did not get a sight of the shy animals, but saw many
      evidences of their work in the stumps and freshly cut pieces of wood. A
      well-beaten path led from their timber reserve to the edge of the water,
      and they evidently floated the timber to their building some twenty rods
      away. The discovery of this colony called out numerous stories from the
      forest ranger of his experiences with the beaver, in the recounting of
      which he referred to the &ldquo;outlaw&rdquo; beaver which lives alone and in a hole
      in the bank of some stream or lake. The Indian theory is that this exile
      has been driven out by the members of his family on account of his bad
      disposition or for some crime committed against the society of which he is
      a member. We must confess to a measure of skepticism as to the absolute
      trustworthiness of this bit of natural history, and only the testimony of
      a well-known naturalist established it in our minds as an indubitable
      fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best August fishing in this section is to be found either in the
      streams or just where they empty into the lakes. Here the sprightly,
      always-up-and-doing brook trout furnish real sport. In the Chippeway
      River, outlet of Trout Lake, we made good catches, and where a spring
      brook empties into the lake, sport that met our highest desires was found.
      One spot on the river made an indelible impression. It was where the
      stream, rushing against a wall of rock, was sharply deflected, forming a
      deep and shaded pool. The timber grew so densely all about that it was
      seemingly impossible to fish this pool from the shore, and its depth made
      wading out of the question. By dint of much climbing and fighting with
      underbrush, the top of the rock was reached, from which point of vantage
      one could look down upon the pool and the big trout lying near the bottom.
      While the rod could not be used on account of the brush, it was possible
      to drop a line into the water from the over-hanging rock, and however
      unsportsmanlike this may have been, it was done with most satisfactory
      results. Eight large trout were pulled up, hand over hand, from this
      secluded retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mouth of the cold brook yielded the largest returns of any one spot
      found during our stay. Just as the sun was going down, to send a cast of
      two or three flies dancing over this water was to be rewarded by doubles
      frequently, while rarely did the flies go untouched. Then back to the
      cabin and, after one of Edwards&rsquo; good suppers and a chat about the roaring
      fire, to bed and to the sleep that &ldquo;knits up the ravelled sleeve of care&rdquo;
       and sends one forth to the new day buoyant and rejoicing.

      HEN our steamer, the &ldquo;Tunisian,&rdquo; docked at Liverpool after a quick and
      pleasant voyage, the two brothers of my good friend and travelling
      companion, Dr. W., were waiting to greet him. It was something like half a
      century since my friend had left his home among the Welsh hills to devote
      his fine mind and loving heart to the ministry of Jesus Christ in America.
      Were this the place, one might write many a chapter concerning the
      faithfulness and fruitfulness of that ministry which has brought such
      priceless blessings to so many lives and helped so largely in building the
      Kingdom of God in the new world. However, it is of his early home rather
      than of the man, that we are to write just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was because the writer was his brother&rsquo;s friend that one of these
      strong-faced Welshmen extended a cordial invitation to be his guest when,
      later on, Dr. W. should visit his native town. So it came to pass that
      after the great meetings in London were over, we started for the little
      village of Garndolbenmaen where Dr. W. was born and had spent his earlier
      years.
    </p>
    <p>
      We had counted not a little on making the ascent of Snowdon, and in spite
      of the cloudy, threatening weather, ascend it we did. Boarding the toylike
      car on the little narrow-gauge road, we were slowly hauled up the mountain
      side. We had hardly begun the ascent when the country about began to
      unroll like a panorama below us. Yonder is a thread-like stream, and
      beyond it the mines with their piles of slack marking each opening. Higher
      up, the clouds were all about us, shutting out everything but the
      immediate vicinity, and before we reached the summit, rain had begun to
      fall. The only relief to our disappointment was when, for a moment, the
      clouds broke and we looked far over mountains and valleys. Down at our
      feet and leading away towards the east was a white road on either side of
      which were little squares of cultivated fields. Towards the south loomed
      the tops of high hills, the sides of which were hidden by the clouds,
      while towards the west we caught just a glimpse of the Straits of Menna.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later we were riding along the shores of the Straits and looking
      across to Anglesea. To those familiar with religious work in Great
      Britain, one figure stands out, giant-like, whenever the name of that
      island is heard. Here Christmas Evans prayed and preached, turning many
      hundreds from sin to righteousness under the sway of his matchless
      eloquence. Farther on we passed Carnarvon Castle where, according to a
      tradition now generally discredited, Edward II, first Prince of Wales, was
      born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night had fallen when we reached the Garn station, a mile or more from the
      village which straggles up the side of one of the foot-hills of the
      Snowdon range. A cheerful fire was blazing in the open fire-place when we
      entered the house, and it seemed a symbol of the warm and generous
      hospitality extended to the American stranger. There is something
      indescribably attractive about one of these Welsh homes. Perhaps
      &ldquo;hominess&rdquo; describes it best. The absence of ceremony and the presence of
      a spirit of kindliness and cordiality put the stranger at his ease from
      the first. The days spent under that roof passed all too swiftly, and, as
      we look back upon them, they set the heart to glowing. Since then the
      master of the house has passed into the great silence, but no change that
      time works can efface the memory of his gracious and considerate
      hospitality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunday in North Wales is a day for rest and worship, not for golf and
      picnics. It was on a Saturday evening that we reached Garn, and it seemed
      like a &ldquo;deserted village&rdquo; when we looked up and down the street the next
      morning. Any such assumption was thoroughly dissipated later on when the
      hour for morning service came. Then people gathered from every direction
      for miles around, and when we entered the plain, Non-Conformist
      Church-house it was filled to the doors, galleries and all. The visitor
      could not understand songs or prayers or sermon, for all were in the Welsh
      tongue. When the sermon began my thoughtful friend, who sat beside me,
      jotted down the salient points of the discourse as the preacher proceeded,
      so that the handicapped American gained a very fair idea of the outline.
      It was not the sermon, however, but the singing that made the strongest
      impression. Needless to say, not a word could be understood, but somehow
      it reached the heart. The dominance of the minor would have been somewhat
      depressing had it not been for the occasional evident exultation and
      rejoicing which swept forth to fill the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the evening service that the most profound impression was made
      upon the writer. The second service of the day closes before it becomes
      necessary to light the lamps. The sun was low in the west, when, after the
      sermon, a man came down from the gallery and stood up before the pulpit to
      sing. That song, in an unfamiliar tongue, melted the heart and filled the
      eyes with tears. The rays of the setting sun fell through the western
      windows upon the singer, and we thought of one in a far-off land and time
      whose face did shine when he returned to his people from talking with God.
      Later on our host told us that this man had been a popular concert singer
      whose heart God had touched during the great revival which had then just
      swept over Wales. The song to which we had listened told of the joy of the
      wanderer when he had come back from the &ldquo;far country&rdquo; to his Father&rsquo;s
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      English is rarely heard on the streets of Garn, and not a few of the
      people of this section are unable to speak anything but the Welsh. On one
      of our days of wandering about the country we met a woman in the highway
      with whom Dr. W. talked in her native tongue. He then told his friend that
      we would stop at the home of this woman a little farther on, and excused
      himself for a moment while he visited a neighbouring farmhouse. Left
      together, the Welsh woman and the American were somewhat at a loss as to
      how conversation might be carried on. It was the woman, of course, who
      solved the difficulty. She knew one English word, and looking the visitor
      in the eye, she smiled and said, &ldquo;America! America!&rdquo; The stranger could
      not even say &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; in Welsh, but he said it in his best Yankee and his
      answering smile was in the universal language. Dr. W. said afterwards that
      this woman&rsquo;s sons were in the United States, and we found few homes from
      which at least one had not gone forth to the new world. It was for the
      sake of her boys, in part, at least, that this woman overwhelmed us with
      attentions when we sat in her home a little later on. Such milk we never
      expect to taste again. When Dr. W. said that she had served us with the
      &ldquo;strippings,&rdquo; he was compelled to explain that the Welsh dairymen keep
      separate the last of the milk taken from the cow&mdash;the &ldquo;strippings&rdquo;&mdash;as
      this is much richer than that given earlier in the milking. Henceforth,
      give us &ldquo;strippings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As one comes to know something of the conditions obtaining in Wales, the
      only wonder is that they do not all emigrate. The land is generally owned
      by non-residents, and the rentals are high. If the tenant rescues a field
      from the rocks and brush, thereby increasing productivity, the rental is
      at once increased. Every one must pay towards the support of the
      Established Church. On the Sunday which we spent in Garn, the two
      Non-Conformist churches of the village were crowded, while only fifteen
      people were present at the services held by the Church of England; yet
      every man of these Calvinistic Methodists and Baptists was taxed for the
      support of the establishment. No more gross injustice in the name of
      religion was ever perpetrated than that from which the Non-Conformists of
      Wales suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley of the Dwyfor is an idyll of peaceful beauty. One afternoon we
      climbed the steep hillside back of the village, and stood upon a giant
      rock jutting out from among its lesser fellows, where, when a mere lad,
      Dr. W. practised preaching to an audience made up of rocks and stones and
      grazing sheep. The spot was of interest not only because of the
      associations but for the extended view that it afforded. We faced the
      village and the valley, and saw the glistening waters of the sea in the
      distance. Here and there a patch of woods could be seen, but for the most
      part one beheld only carefully cultivated and fruitful fields. The Dwyfor
      is not a great river save in its quiet beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Are you built so that every stream of water, even the output of the
      melting snow in the springtime, seems to say &ldquo;Fish!&rdquo;? Whether fortunately
      or unfortunately, the writer has never been able to keep his imagination
      from capering about when in the presence of lake or river. The shining
      Dwyfor had an irresistible appeal, and our host was subjected to
      cross-examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are there any fish in the Dwyfor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trout.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would I be permitted to fish it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, by taking out a license.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you any tackle?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly, and you are more than welcome to use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rod was heavier and stiffer than the American was accustomed to use,
      and the flies were absolute strangers; but, nothing daunted, the fisherman
      paid for his license and betook himself to the river. It is probable that
      Dr. W. would have little choice between going fishing and serving a term
      in jail; but the unselfish man trudged patiently along with his friend. If
      ever a stream was clearer or its banks more absolutely lacking in
      everything that would screen the fisherman, it is unknown to the writer.
      The sky was almost cloudless, no wind rippled the surface of the water,
      and we have a suspicion that every trout in the Dwyfor saw us when we
      started from Garn. At all events, they had hied them to safe retreats from
      which they looked contemptuously upon the fisherman and his futile efforts
      to fool them. One deluded fish, nearly as long as one&rsquo;s finger, did lose
      his mental poise for a moment, just long enough to grab the fly. The
      verdict of temporary lunacy was promptly rendered by both Dr. W. and the
      fisherman, and the trout was returned to the water. Fishing in the Dwyfor
      was a flat failure, so far as returns in fish go.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the fish were not the only returns of the day. When it was evident
      even to the most optimistic that fishing was wasted effort, Dr. W.
      suggested that we were not far from a &ldquo;cromlech,&rdquo; and off we started. A
      mile or so along the road, and then across the fields, and we came to one
      of the many Druidical remains to be found in Great Britain. The circle was
      small, not more than ten feet in diameter, all the stones standing and
      having a large, flat stone covering the top. Who were the builders? Why
      was it built? No voice comes from the weather-beaten stones, and wise men
      give differing answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun is almost touching the summit of the western hills when we reach
      Garn. We have tramped many miles, made a colossal failure of fishing, but
      there has been delightful comradeship, the blue sky, fair fields, hours in
      God&rsquo;s open, and we are happy.

    <p>
      HERE&rsquo;S a clam!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where? I don&rsquo;t see it! Can&rsquo;t I get it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Of course he could get it, for the water in the creek was shallow and the
      father remembered his own boyhood too well to deny the little chap&rsquo;s
      request. So the boat was stopped while the boy, arm bared to the shoulder,
      reached down to the sandy bottom of the stream and captured his first
      clam.
    </p>
    <p>
      You don&rsquo;t see anything interesting in that? So much the worse for you. It
      interested the boy, and the boy&rsquo;s interest was quite enough to enlist and
      hold the interest of the father. If you do not yet know that whatever
      appeals to the mind of a child is important, however insignificant that
      thing may be in itself, you have something to learn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two, father and boy, had left the log cabin among the pines soon after
      breakfast in search of minnows for use in fishing. When they started out
      the boy went along simply because the two were chums and almost
      inseparable companions. The father had no thought of what that stream
      might mean to the lad, and he learned a lesson that morning which he will
      never forget. He had spent his boyhood in the country and had never
      stopped to think that the sights and sounds along this stream would all be
      unfamiliar to his city-bred son.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not gone far up the stream before another discovery was made, and
      two baby snails joined the clam on the seat. Then a crawfish was seen
      scuttling over the gravel and was added to the collection. By this time
      the boy was bubbling over with interest and enthusiasm, but when, rounding
      a bend in the stream, a turtle was discovered sunning himself on a bit of
      drift-wood, it was evident that the wonders of this wonderful stream had
      reached their climax. Cautiously the boat was moved toward the turtle&rsquo;s
      resting-place, but just before he was reached he quietly slid off into the
      water. It would not do to leave the lad in such an ocean of disappointment
      as swallowed him up when that turtle disappeared, so, with landing net in
      hand, they watched for his reappearance. It seemed hours to the boy before
      the beady eyes of the turtle were seen looking up at them from the moss
      where he had found a hiding-place. Then a careful manipulation of the net,
      a sudden scoop, and the turtle was scrambling about in the bottom of the
      boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See him snap! Will he bite me? Look at the markings of his shell! How old
      do you suppose he is? What do turtles eat? I&rsquo;m going to take him home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Questions and exclamations crowded and jostled each other as the eager lad
      studied his latest prize.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the captives had been carried to the cabin and duly admired by other
      members of the family, the question arose as to what should be done with
      them. Throw them back? Eager protests from their owner. When he was
      finally convinced that they were not altogether adapted to serve as pocket
      pieces, he proposed an aquarium, and aquarium it was. An ancient and
      discarded dish-pan was found, the holes filled with rags, water and rocks
      supplied, and clams, crawfish, snails and turtles were compelled to live
      in seeming amity, whatever their personal feelings may have been. Later on
      other turtles were added to the collection, and a yellow lizard with a
      blue tail gave the finishing touch to this conglomerate of animal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      How shall we educate the young? This question, holding first place in the
      hearts of parents and lovers of children, elicits clamorous and often
      contradictory answers. The advocate of &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; studies finds a sturdy
      antagonist in the defender of &ldquo;vocational&rdquo; training, and school boards
      make frantic efforts to please everybody, and succeed, as is common in
      such cases, in pleasing nobody. Meanwhile, our children are the helpless
      and unfortunate victims of a series of experiments, as the school
      authorities try out different educational theories.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far be it from the writer to propose a solution of the difficulty or to
      proffer any panacea for our educational ills; but in all humility he
      ventures to suggest the desirability of making it possible for the child
      to know something about the world in which he lives. Book-learning,
      essential as it is, is not enough if we would fit the child to live the
      larger and more joyous life. When we have studied literature and art and
      philosophy and science, when we have become familiar with the great cities
      with their bewildering sights and distracting sounds, the finest things
      remain to be discovered, and these discoveries must be made as we stand
      open-eyed in the presence of God&rsquo;s workmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hills and streams, woods and flowers, bees and birds and butterflies, the
      flora and fauna of this earth where we have our home for a little time,
      should, somehow, be brought into the life of the child. The boy who grows
      up into manhood without being privileged to know the world of nature by
      personal contact has been robbed. He may be intelligent in many things and
      a useful member of society, but he has missed out of life some of its
      deepest satisfactions and purest joys. Indeed, such an one is not
      symmetrically educated, and is quite likely to be put to shame as the
      years pass. A story is told of a young woman, able to order her breakfast
      in six different languages, who, spending some days in the home of a
      farmer, made most mortifying mistakes concerning the common things of
      country life. When, coming down to breakfast one morning she discovered a
      plate of honey on the table, she felt that the time had come for a display
      of her knowledge and for the discomfiture of those who had laughed at her
      mistakes, and exclaimed, &ldquo;Ah! I see that you keep a bee.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Take the witness box! Yes, I am speaking to you, middle-aged man,
      city-dweller, slave to business, familiar with paved streets and great
      buildings, the honk of automobile horns and the love songs of vagrant
      cats.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you born in the country?&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;Forgotten it! Sometimes I can think of nothing else, and always something
      out of that boyhood is popping up even in the midst of my business
      undertakings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you regret that you were not born in the city?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Regret it? Say, you are fooling. I wouldn&rsquo;t trade the recollections of my
      boyhood on the farm for the best business block in this city.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it can&rsquo;t be worth anything to you in a business way. Life in the
      country doesn&rsquo;t train one to manufacture gas engines.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve never stopped to consider what I owe in the matter of business
      success to my boyhood in the country, but now that you raise the question,
      I&rsquo;m inclined to believe that it gave me pretty good training in some ways
      for the business in which I am engaged.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I came into this business at the age of twenty I was given a place
      in the shipping department at a salary of seven dollars per week. Now I am
      at the head of the firm, while many of the fellows who were with me in
      those days are still working on salary. You see I had the advantage of the
      city boys in being accustomed to work. On the farm I had my regular tasks.
      Why, when I was a little chap I wiped the dishes for mother, and when I
      grew older I had to keep the wood-box filled and go after the cows and
      pick up potatoes and&mdash;but you know what a lot of things there are to
      do on a farm where &lsquo;a boy can help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now that I think of it, I imagine that I was learning application,
      industry and self-control&mdash;big assets in business. The city-bred boy
      has never had that schooling. He has not been trained to hold himself to
      hard and continued effort. It is not his fault, and I do not know that his
      parents are to be blamed. I have two boys of my own born in the city, and
      one of the questions which perplexes me most is how to provide them with
      regular tasks that shall develop their sense of responsibility and
      cultivate habits of industry and application. Although I could afford to
      have a man to take care of the lawn and attend to the furnace, I have the
      boys do this work for their own sakes. It is good as far as it goes, but I
      am afraid it does not go far enough. They have too much time to spend in
      doing nothing, and habits of idleness formed in boyhood are likely to
      stick when one comes to manhood. I do not believe in manufacturing tasks
      or setting them at work which is not real, for boys are keen observers and
      you cannot fool them into believing that they are doing something worth
      while when compelled to take wood from one corner of the cellar and pile
      it in another corner, and then shift it back again. The man who devises
      some way of supplying real tasks for the boys of the well-to-do city
      families will be a public benefactor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, that you have started the discussion of this subject, how about the
      physical health and strength that I brought from my country life to the
      work which I am doing? Of course, we have our sleeping porches and
      playgrounds and medical inspection in the public schools, and are doing
      what we can to build sound bodies for our city children, but I suspect
      that the out-door life of the country boy and his regular exercise and
      plain food furnish a far and away better physical preparation for the
      strenuous work of business life than anything we are able to devise for
      our children in the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never saw my old home, did you? Well, the house stood at the foot of
      a hill and close by a little stream. In the summer time the wild
      strawberries in the meadow above the orchard were so thick that I remember
      picking a bushel there one day. For raspberries and blackberries we
      usually went some three or four miles to Babcock Hollow, but once there
      you could fill a ten-quart pail in no time at all, and they were the
      sweetest, most luscious berries you ever tasted. Then, in the fall, came
      apple picking and potato digging and corn cutting and nut gathering. There
      were dozens of butternut trees in the pasture-lot through which the creek
      ran, and on Button Hill you could get all the chestnuts you wished. Did
      you ever gather beechnuts? They are so little that picking them up by hand
      is slow work. We used to take three or four sheets, spread them under a
      beech tree, after the first frost had opened the burrs, and then one of
      the boys would climb the tree and pound the limbs, sending the nuts down
      upon the sheets in showers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the winters! When there was a good crust on the snow you could start
      on your sled at the patch of woods on the top of the hill, nearly a mile
      away, and ride right into our barnyard. I&rsquo;ve done it many a time. Skating!
      We could go almost straight away for miles on the river. One night when
      Jim Gilbert&rsquo;s people were away from home I got permission to stay all
      night with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I took my skates along and after supper we came down to the river and
      skated. The moon was full and it was almost as light as day. I must have
      been careless, for I skated too near an open place and broke through. Jim
      was just behind me, and, before he could stop or change his course, he had
      stubbed his toe on me and in he went, head first. The water was shallow,
      so there was no danger, but we had a mile to walk in our wet clothes, and
      all the way up hill. I remember that our clothes were frozen stiff when we
      reached Jim&rsquo;s house. We built a roaring fire, stripped off our wet clothes
      and put on some that were dry, and then sat up until one o&rsquo;clock eating
      chestnuts and popcorn and talking about what we would do when we were men.
      Jim had an idea that he would be a lawyer, but the last time I saw him he
      was selling tooth paste at the county fair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In some ways spring in the country is not remarkably attractive. The
      fields are brown and bare and soggy, and the winds cannot fairly be called
      zephyrs. As the frost leaves the ground the roads become rivers of mud,
      and some of the &ldquo;sinkholes&rdquo; seem bottomless. Early spring is easily the
      most unlovely time of the year in the country, but even then life has its
      brighter side. With the first breath of the south wind the sap begins to
      leave the roots of the hard maples and the sugar season begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever work in a sugar-bush? No? Poor fellow! You&rsquo;ve missed
      something worth while out of your life. I understand that nowadays they
      evaporate the sap in shallow pans; we used to boil it in a big iron
      kettle. We did not have many maples on our place, so I sometimes worked
      for Deacon Bouton, who had the next farm west of ours. He had a big
      sugar-bush, and we carried the pails of sap on neck-yokes. When we had a
      big run of sap we had to boil all night as well as during the day. I&rsquo;ll
      never forget one night when we had a feast. There were two boys besides
      myself: Ed Bouton, the deacon&rsquo;s son, and John Hammond. Ed had brought
      forty-five hen&rsquo;s eggs and John added five goose eggs. We boiled the eggs
      in the sap, and the three of us ate those forty-five hen&rsquo;s eggs and
      started on the goose eggs. For some reason we did not relish them.
      Possibly the hen&rsquo;s eggs had taken the keen edge from our appetites.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But how I&rsquo;m running on! Regret being born in the country? Do you know
      that I can shut my eyes and see the hills and meadows and orchard, fairer
      than any ever put in colours on the canvas? I can see the oriole&rsquo;s nest
      swinging from a branch of the big elm in the corner of our yard and the
      nest of the pewee under the bridge. Just across the road in the meadow are
      glorious masses of violets, and mother&rsquo;s peonies and sweet pinks beat
      anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen since. When I&rsquo;m dog-tired from the day&rsquo;s work it
      rests me just to think of the quiet and calm and beauty of the old home
      among the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s another thing that I want to tell you: when I go into the
      country I can enjoy it. One of my best friends, born in the city, is bored
      almost to death every time he tries to take a vacation in the country. He
      doesn&rsquo;t know the difference between a hard maple and a tamarack, and asked
      me once if a woodchuck was likely to attack a human being if not angered.
      He&rsquo;s afraid of bees and garter snakes, and even a friendly old
      &ldquo;daddy-long-legs&rdquo; gives him a nervous shock. He can&rsquo;t enjoy the fields and
      flowers, for he was brought up on people and bricks. I&rsquo;d like to be back
      there at the old place this minute. I&rsquo;ll bet I could find some raspberries
      on the bushes that grow in the fence corners along the west road. We used
      to string them on timothy stalks as we came home from school, and I&rsquo;ve
      never tasted any such berries since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The witness is through with his testimony and we&rsquo;ll submit the case to the
      jury without argument. What do you say, fathers and mothers of the city?
      Shall your children have a chance to learn nature&rsquo;s secrets at first hand?
      Will you give them some time in the open every year, where the work of man
      has not elbowed the work of God into a corner and out of sight? More, will
      you help to send the children of the poor, children whose playground is
      the city street, and to whom the stories of green fields and limpid
      streams and flowers that belong to any who will gather them, sound like
      fairy tales&mdash;will you give to these children of the tenement and the
      slums days where the sunshine is not filtered through a bank of smoke and
      all the ministry of God&rsquo;s unspoiled work strengthens them for the coming
      days of toil?

      F the sucker had gone twenty feet farther up the little brook on his
      foraging expedition this story would not have been written. However, by
      the time he had appropriated some ten thousand trout eggs, the hunger
      which had urged him into the mouth of the brook deserted him, and, as the
      water was too cold for his liking, he made his way back to the river where
      he could take a siesta in the pool that he had left that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just above the spot where the sucker turned about was a bend in the
      stream, and, passing that, you came upon a reach of shallow water running
      over the most beautiful bed of gravel in that whole section. It was here
      that the Bully was born, in the afternoon of the very day when destruction
      in the form of a predatory sucker came so near to him. Not that he
      appeared much like a bully in those first hours of conscious existence. In
      fact he looked more like an animated sliver with a sack suspended from
      underneath. He moved slowly about the stream in company with a hundred or
      so other little fellows until the sack had disappeared, and then it was
      easy to see that he had the advantage of all his comrades in the matter of
      size at least.

    <p>
      When they began feeding upon the tiny forms of life found in the creek,
      the Bully soon gained a reputation for pugnaciousness. He did not hesitate
      to crowd his best friend away from a larva, and, before he was an inch
      long, he had bitten the left pectoral fin from one of his comrades who had
      ventured to resist the Bully&rsquo;s attempt to rob him of a luscious little
      snail that he had discovered. One day when the Bully was yet a fingerling
      he joined battle with a chub twice his size, and, although he lost a part
      of his tail in the fray, and all the spectators thought he was whipped
      before the conflict had fairly begun, the thought of giving up never
      occurred to him, and he fought until his foe turned tail and fled into the
      river, a quarter of a mile away.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still living in the brook and had come to be almost four inches in
      length when he had an experience that shook his nerves somewhat. As he was
      resting beside a sod a little worm, all bent out of shape, but undeniably
      of the vermes family, came floating down the stream and he promptly
      grabbed it. Then came a sharp prick in his lip and something was pulling
      him out from under the sod. He braced and twisted and threshed about, but
      all in vain. Up he went out of the water, all the time doing fancy
      somersaults such as he had never attempted before. A moment later he
      struck the water with a splash and was soon safely hidden under the sod
      again. From his hiding-place he watched that worm come floating past him
      again and yet again, but he had learned caution. Now that he looked
      closely, he saw that the worm was fastened to the end of a string, and a
      little later he discovered that this string was tied to a stick which was
      in the possession of some creature that walked along the bank of the
      stream. Later on he learned that this strange animal was a small boy and
      that all members of this species were his enemies. Whether or not he ever
      realized that he owed his life to the fact that the boy had lost the last
      of his store hooks and was using a bent pin that day, no one knows.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that summer the Bully lived in the brook; but when the days grew
      shorter and it began to freeze he moved with his friends into the river.
      That winter, when the river was frozen over except in shallow places where
      the current was swift, he had a narrow escape from a mink. He was talking
      with a trout much older and larger than himself about the comparative
      merits of worms and flies as food when a dark form darted towards them
      with open jaws, and, with one snap, his neighbour was captured and carried
      away. This foray caused great excitement in the trout colony, and the
      Bully learned for the first time of the existence of rapacious animals
      frequenting the banks of the river which made their living by capturing
      unwary trout.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following summer he spent in exploring the river above the point where
      the brook joined it. Here there were hills crowding close in on either
      side of the river, and rapids were numerous and strong. Practice in
      rushing up the swift water brought his muscles to such a state of
      development that every now and then he would spend half an hour in jumping
      out of the water as far as he could. In fact he entered a jumping contest
      held under the auspices of the Hemlock Point Trout Club late in July, and
      carried off the first prize, an enormous blue-bottle fly. The judges on
      this occasion decided that his jump was two and a half times his own
      length which would probably make it some twelve inches. It was during this
      summer that he became expert in taking game on the wing. There is a
      tradition among the Oswegatchie trout that on one occasion, with a
      favourable start, he pulled down a &ldquo;devil&rsquo;s darning-needle&rdquo; that was
      flying eighteen inches above the surface of the water and going at the
      rate of sixty miles an hour. N. B.&mdash;This is merely a tradition and is
      unsupported by trustworthy historical evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bullying tendencies waxed strong during this second summer. One
      dislikes to set it down, but it was about this time that he entered upon
      those cannibalistic practices in which he persisted for the rest of his
      life. One dark and chilly day, when all the millers and bugs and flies
      seemed to have gone into retreat, noon came and found him with a gnawing
      pain in his stomach which made him almost beside himself. Unfortunately
      when his hunger was at its height a little trout that was playing tag with
      some of its fellows happened to jostle him. In his anger the Bully snapped
      at and swallowed him. For a moment he was conscience-stricken, and then,
      when he realized what a delicious morsel he had taken to himself, he
      turned to and grabbed up fifteen other little members of his family
      without stopping to take breath. Henceforth he was looked upon as a social
      outcast by the best people in troutdom and his only intimacies were among
      the tough and lawless members of the community. Doubtless he brooded over
      this ostracism, and grew bitter as he realized the evident contempt in
      which he was held. At any rate, he waxed more and more cantankerous and
      disagreeable as he grew bigger and stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      A record of all the experiences through which the Bully passed would fill
      a volume. Only a few of the many can be set down in this brief biography,
      and those the more important ones. When he was three years old he was
      recognized as the boss of the river above the brook. For some time stories
      had come up stream of the prowess of a big trout living five miles down
      the stream in a mill pond. Confident in his ability to whip anything that
      wore fins, the Bully started down stream one May morning bent upon
      challenging this far-famed warrior to mortal combat. He had gone about
      one-half the distance and had stopped to rest for a little in a riffle,
      head up stream, when a strange looking fly came hopping and dancing across
      the water. It was many coloured, but that which attracted him most
      strongly was its body, which shone like burnished silver. Without the
      least hesitation, he made a grab for it only to feel that same stinging in
      the lip which followed upon his experience with the crooked worm when he
      was a little fellow. Fortunately for him he had touched the fly lightly,
      and, while he felt a pull for an instant, it was only in the skin of his
      lip, and that, for some strange reason, was torn. Fie started down stream
      vowing that never again would he snap at a fly with a silver body.

      By the second morning he had reached the pond, and found himself among
      strangers. It did not take long for him to become involved in a scrap with
      a trout of about his own size from which he quickly emerged triumphant.
      Had the pond not furnished seemingly unlimited supplies of fat chubs he
      would have proceeded to give free rein to his cannibalistic inclinations;
      but as it was less trouble to catch the chubs than his own blood
      relations, he filled himself with the former, and then took a nap under
      the shadow of a big stump, the top of which stood a little way out of the
      water.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little before sundown, when he was quite refreshed and had begun to
      think of taking a little turn about the pond in search of adventure, he
      heard the sound of many voices, and, looking out from his hiding-place,
      saw a company of trout moving in his direction. In the lead was his foe of
      the morning. There, surrounded by an admiring crowd, came the biggest
      trout that Bully had ever seen. His under jaw projected far beyond its
      mate and had an ugly upward curve. He was broad across the back and thick
      through and moved with all the pride of a conquering hero. &ldquo;Where is he?
      Show him to me. I&rsquo;ll make mincemeat of the insolent intruder.&rdquo; The booming
      voice of the big fellow left the Bully in no doubt as to the identity of
      the approaching monster. It was the fighter of whom he was in search.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bully would have been scared if that possibility had not been denied
      him. Instead of fleeing in fear he came out from under cover and shouted:
      &ldquo;Are you talking about me? You big bluffer! I&rsquo;ll make you food for the
      crows.&rdquo; If the truth must be told, both the combatants used language that
      was not only exceedingly scurrilous, but shockingly profane. In this
      gentle exercise the Bully had the best of it and the pond trout became so
      enraged that he dashed at his enemy with jaws extended. The Bully was so
      busy swearing that he came near losing his life. As it was, he dodged just
      in time to prevent those powerful jaws from closing upon him, but not
      quickly enough to escape a slashing from two big teeth which laid his side
      open in deep gashes. He was a surprised Bully, but not dismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The battle that followed had no historian. Of much that took place, the
      whirling and darting, the snapping and struggling, the reports that have
      come down through the years are somewhat confused and even contradictory.
      It seems clear that at the first the Bully had the worst of it. Besides
      the gashes received in the first attack, he lost one fin and a piece of
      his tail early in the fray. The pond trout had all the advantage in size
      and was cheered on by his friends; but the Bully&rsquo;s gymnastic exercises,
      fighting with the rapids, stood him in good stead now. His muscles were
      steel, while those of the pond trout had grown somewhat flabby since he
      had come to content himself with life in the still water. As they feinted
      and charged and whirled about, the pond champion began to grow short of
      breath and found increasing difficulty in meeting the rushes of the Bully,
      who seemed to grow more agile as the battle raged. Then there came a
      moment when the Bully feinted for his opponent&rsquo;s tail, and, when the pond
      trout turned suddenly to guard his caudal extremity, he left his throat
      unguarded for an instant&mdash;and it was all over. Once the Bully had set
      his teeth into the white throat he shook and raged and tore while the
      life-blood of his foe gushed out, and the denizens of the pond saw their
      supposedly invincible warrior die before their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is known, certainly, of the Bully&rsquo;s life after this up to the day
      that he met his death. It is whispered that before leaving the pond he
      undertook to capture a white miller that came fluttering over the surface
      of the water just at dusk one night and found himself fast at the end of a
      line as in his boyhood. Some even assume to say that after vainly flinging
      himself into the air in the effort to shake the miller out of his mouth,
      he said goodbye to those who had been drawn about him by his struggles,
      and was about ready to give up hope when one last struggle took him over
      and under a root and he found himself free. They even go so far as to say
      that for many a day after that the miller stuck to the Bully&rsquo;s jaw, and
      that from it floated a fine, white thread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another unsupported rumour has it that as he was going up stream one day
      in a narrow part of the stream he found a fine bunch of branches and
      leaves, and gladly pushed in among them when he heard a disturbance in the
      water back of him. No sooner had he entered this refuge than it began to
      rise out of the water, and he shortly found himself on shore and being
      handled by an animal that resembled the boy who had given him so much
      trouble years before, only much larger. Even then he would not give up
      without an effort, and, summoning all his strength, he gave a mighty
      squirm and escaped out of his captor&rsquo;s hands. He struck on the gravel,
      gave two or three tremendous leaps and was in water again, free.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bully had grown to be the biggest trout in all that stretch of water,
      and his under jaw protruded as far and was quite as hooked as had been
      that of his vanquished enemy of the pond. An August morning found him well
      up the river in the dense woods where the water was cool and food was
      abundant. He had found a place where the water was some four feet deep,
      and a fallen tree-top made the finest kind of a hiding-place. Just above
      him was a clear space some two feet in diameter where now and then he
      could take a bug or a foolish miller. Lying at his ease, he thought with
      satisfaction of his numerous victories over other trout and of his good
      fortune in escaping those strange beings which prowled along the shore and
      threw enticing flies or worms into the stream. Just then&mdash;but, before
      we tell of this incident, we must bring in another story. That morning
      four men had broken camp some miles down the stream and started on a
      sixteen-mile tramp back into the woods, where they were to spend a month
      on the shore of a lake, fishing and hunting. The duffle was piled upon a
      rude sled drawn along the trail by a horse. When two of the party were
      ready to start ahead of the others, the guide, Fide Scott, said to one of
      them, the Preacher, &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll follow the river for more than half the way,
      and if you fellows can catch some trout we&rsquo;ll have &lsquo;em for dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Preacher already had hooks and a line in his pocket, and at once added
      a supply of fat angle worms from the common stock. They had walked for an
      hour or more when they came to a point on the river where a tree had
      fallen across the stream. Just below this natural bridge the water was
      deep and still, and a great mass of brush seemed to promise an ideal
      hiding-place for trout. To make conditions exceptionally favourable there
      was a good-sized open place in the centre of the brush where one might
      drop his lure without the absolute certainty of getting snagged. The line
      came out of the Preacher&rsquo;s pocket in a hurry, the hook was tied on and two
      exceedingly well-developed worms were looped in such a way as to be as
      enticing as possible. A piece of alder, six feet or so in length, was
      pressed into service and everything was ready for the piscatorial
      adventure. But the pole was too short. Doing his best, the fisherman could
      not stand on the shore and drop his bait into that open spot in the brush.
      Only one thing remained, and that was to walk out on the log, from which
      the bark had dropped away, leaving it as slippery as the cellar door down
      which the Preacher had been wont to slide as a boy. Slowly and with
      exceeding caution the adventurer made his way inch by inch along the log
      until he had reached a point from which he could drop his hook into that
      most attractive opening in the brush. Balancing himself carefully, he
      allowed that mass of wriggling worms to touch the surface of the water
      when&mdash;but now we&rsquo;ll go back to the Bully.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he saw that bunch of angleworms just above him he forgot the crooked
      worm which had pricked him in his childhood. He was sure that here was the
      most satisfying morsel that had ever come his way and rushed for it. He
      closed his jaws on only a part of the mass, and the rest disappeared, much
      to his disappointment. What he secured made him eager for more. It was
      distinctly more palatable than anything he had tasted for many a moon.
      Just as he was longing for more of the same kind&mdash;behold! another
      bunch of wriggling, squirming worms appeared in almost the same spot. This
      time he did not propose to lose any of this meal so providentially
      provided, and he made a rush that enabled him not only to grab the entire
      mass, but to get it well back in his mouth. Then came that upward pull
      which he had felt in former experiences. He kicked and struggled and
      threshed, making the water boil about him. For a little his upward
      progress seemed to be stayed and he imagined that he would get free after
      all. Then his ascent began again and continued, despite all his mighty
      protests, until he felt himself enwrapped and almost smothered by
      something, he knew not what. The Bully of the Upper Oswe-gatchie never
      knew what happened after that. He could not see the painfully anxious face
      of the Preacher endeavouring to balance himself on a peeled log and haul a
      big trout out of the brush by a sheer pull. He had no knowledge of the
      fervour with which the Preacher embraced him, or of the perilous journey
      to the shore along that treacherous pathway. He could not see the comrade
      of the Preacher when, excited by the splashing made by the Bully in his
      efforts to get off the hook, he jumped into the stream in his anxiety to
      be of help.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the rest of the party came up, there upon the grass lay a noble fish,
      and the proud Preacher was fairly sizzling with eagerness to tell all
      about the capture. There was nothing with which to weigh the Bully, but he
      measured a plump twenty-two inches in length and Fide Scott placed his
      weight at a good five pounds. That Preacher fairly split the buttons from
      his coat, swelling with pride when the guide exclaimed: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived along
      the Oswegatchie for fifty years and he&rsquo;s the biggest trout I ever saw took
      out of the river.&rdquo;

      HE backward look reveals many-isolated bits of experience in the
      out-of-doors, not one of them important enough to form the nucleus of a
      story of respectable size, and yet to each one crying out every time we
      glance in its direction: &ldquo;Tell about me!&rdquo; If the reader finds nothing of
      interest in these odds and ends, he who writes may at least hope to quiet
      the importunities of these clamorous voices from out of the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Canasawacta Creek is usually a quiet, inoffensive stream, making its
      way between the low-lying hills of central New York to its union with the
      Chenango River. The rain had been falling steadily all day and the creek
      was somewhat swollen when the families in the little hamlet at South
      Plymouth retired for the night, but no one thought of danger. Shortly
      after midnight a little chap in one of those homes was awakened by his
      father, who lifted him out of his trundle bed and wrapped him in a
      blanket. The lad did not understand what had happened, even when he saw
      the water ankle-deep on the living-room floor, or when his father carried
      him through the swiftly rushing flood to the house of a neighbour on the
      height of land. It never occurred to him to be afraid so long as his
      father&rsquo;s arms were about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the sunshine of the next morning father and boy walked hand in hand
      down the street to the home which they had so hastily abandoned the night
      before. The creek had returned to its bed and was behaving much as usual.
      The boy wondered not a little at the flood-wood left stranded against the
      picket fence, and was not slow to begin an investigation of the changes
      wrought in his playground by the visitor of the previous night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over towards one corner of the yard was a depression in the ground with
      water still standing in it, and as the lad passed this pool he saw
      something moving. Although less than three years old, he had learned that
      a moving object in the water was very likely to be a fish. Young as he
      was, a great passion of pursuit seized him, and he grabbed with both hands
      at the object dimly seen through the roily water. Conviction became a
      certainty as he felt the fish squirm out of his grasp and received a
      splash of muddy water as the frightened victim struggled in the shallow
      pool. Clean clothes and a mother&rsquo;s injunctions were forgotten in the lust
      of the chase. In he waded and gathered that fish to his heart with both
      arms. When the father returned from investigating conditions in the house,
      there stood the lad, wet, muddy, but triumphant. What kind of a fish? The
      boy neither knew nor cared. It was a fish&mdash;and that was quite enough,
      especially when accompanied by the unquestioning conviction that it was
      the biggest fish in all the world. Since that boy has grown to manhood he
      has often said to himself as he looked upon an unpromising bit of water,
      &ldquo;You never can tell. If fish are to be caught in your front dooryard,
      where may you not find them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many trout come to view as we peer into the mists of the long ago, but,
      among them all, two are in a class by themselves. One of them came out of
      the Otselic River on a day when the boy had been berrying and had made a
      failure. Swinging his empty pail, he came to the river just where it had
      dug its way into the bank and formed a deep pool over which the alders
      hung. No normal boy goes abroad on any day, save Sunday, without a
      fishhook and line in his pocket. Bringing forth these essentials to
      happiness, he found a pole, dug an angleworm from a muddy spot, and
      dropped his bait just where the water was blackest. Sunfish and perch and
      eels abounded in this river, but it was not famous for trout. In fact,
      this boy was not fishing for trout and so was all the more amazed when,
      after a sharp struggle, he landed a speckled monster on the grassy bank.
      At least he seemed a monster in size to the boy, and a conservative adult
      estimate would place the fish at well over a pound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, failure to find berries appeared plainly providential, for here was
      the empty pail and the trout could be carried home alive. Under the porch
      at the back of the house was a half-hogshead, set into the ground, into
      which poured a little stream of pure, soft spring water brought from the
      nearby hillside through a lead pipe. Did a trout ever have a more ideal
      place of residence? Here he lived and thrived for many a day, fed with
      untiring regularity until&mdash;just here memory fails. Possibly he died
      of old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy had grown somewhat older and had learned to make and use the
      &ldquo;snare,&rdquo; when he went on a visit to friends in Cortland. Cortland is a
      thriving city now, and even then was a wide-awake and bustling village;
      but its chief attraction to the boy was its river&mdash;the Tioughnioga.
      No sooner had he said &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; to his relatives than he hurried to
      the river bridge to snare suckers. Now don&rsquo;t sniff, you owners of
      hand-made split-bamboo rods and scorners of all fishing except that for
      trout or bass! If you will just think back along the years until you catch
      sight of yourself as you once were, you will realize that the boy knows
      but one rule when fishing, and that is, &ldquo;Get there!&rdquo; Methods do not matter
      to him so that he catches fish. Neither has he learned that dainty
      discrimination among the inhabitants of the water that comes with the
      years. We know boys, even in these days, who would rather stand on a log
      and catch unlimited numbers of sunfish, than to fish all day and take a
      half-dozen bass.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had borrowed a cane pole, and the line, with the slipping-noose of
      shining copper wire at the end, was soon dangling over the side of the
      bridge. Yes, the suckers were still there just about as they had been a
      month before when he saw them but lacked the paraphernalia for their
      capture. Of course, they were not good eating, for it was summer-time and
      their flesh was soft. So, as often as one was derricked wriggling to the
      bridge, it was thrown back, and the process repeated. Naturally, he sought
      to catch the biggest ones, and when he discovered one of unusual size
      lying in the shadow of a rock he was all a-tingle with desire and anxiety.
      Cautiously he dropped the snare well above the fish and gently guided it
      down with the current until the copper wire was well back of the gills,
      and then jerked. Hurrah! he had him! Sucker? Not with that mouth and the
      beautiful carmine spots upon its sides. It is a trout, and a big one. The
      suckers had lost their charm, and a bee-line was made for the house of his
      friends that he might &lsquo;have company in his rejoicing. Passing along the
      street, proudly dangling the big trout from an alder sprout, he was met by
      a man who stopped to admire the fish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did you catch him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down at the bridge. I snared him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Snared him? Don&rsquo;t you know that&rsquo;s illegal?&rdquo; When the good-natured man,
      who had not forgotten that he was once a boy, had explained that snaring a
      trout laid one liable to fine or imprisonment, a scared, small boy sneaked
      by back-ways, and with the trout carefully hidden under his jacket, to the
      home of his friends. Heretofore game laws had not entered into his scheme
      of life. He was worried and unhappy; but nothing happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every fisherman has his favourite lure for bass. Some put their trust in
      frogs, others swear by minnows. The crawfish, dobson, fly, spoon, worm,
      lamprey, pork-rind, and almost innumerable other supposed attractions,&mdash;each
      has its enthusiastic champions. But what will you do when all these fail?
      It came pretty near being that question which was faced by the boy who
      sought to capture the big bass lying under the Erie Canal bridge. On sunny
      days one could stand on the bridge and see a score or more of bass resting
      near the bottom of the canal, but this particular fish, of aldermanic
      proportions, made all the others seem like infants. The boy could and did
      catch some of these bass, but the prize fish maintained a tantalizing
      indifference to all that was offered. Once or twice he had rubbed his nose
      against a fat minnow that was dangled directly in front of him, but
      usually he treated the most enticing morsel with utter disdain. The boy
      had exhausted his repertoire of attractions, when, on a certain morning,
      he made his way to the bridge with the fixed purpose to ignore the big
      bass and devote himself to more responsive members of that family. As he
      trudged along the road he noticed an apple peeling that had been cast away
      by some passer-by. A part of it was brilliant red. An idea popped into the
      lad&rsquo;s mind, only to be turned out of doors as absurd. But it would not
      stay outside. Again and again it returned asking hospitality, but the boy
      was firm and continued on his way. Once more, as he fished, that
      preposterous idea thrust itself upon him, and finally he retraced his
      steps and picked up the apple-peeling. Going back to the bridge, he
      fastened a piece of the red peeling to his hook, red side down, stood well
      out of sight of the fish, and began wiggling his pole in such a way that
      the brilliant peeling was compelled to dance a jig on the surface of the
      water. Only a moment of suspense, and then came a strike that almost
      carried him off his feet. Was it the big one? The pole bent until it
      threatened to snap in two. Pushing it rapidly backwards through his hands,
      he grasped the line and proceeded to haul in hand over hand. Of course a
      number of things might happen, any one of which would be a measureless
      calamity. But the line did not part, the hook did not tear out, the
      heavens did not fall, and when at last a noble bass was safely landed on
      the bridge the boy let out a yell that might have been heard in Syracuse.
      Five pounds, four ounces, he weighed, and his relatives under the canal
      bridge knew him no more for ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bass has countless vagaries, and one never knows what he will do under
      given circumstances. As a father and son were fishing for small-mouth on
      the St. Lawrence, the senior hooked a fish which broke the snood and went
      free. Now there is a persistent tradition that, when a bass has been
      pricked by the hook, he does not bite again until the passing of
      twenty-four hours or such a matter has served to wipe the experience from
      his memory. In less than an hour the boy caught a two-pounder having in
      its jaws the identical snood which the father had lost. The tradition was
      discredited, unless we assume that the one caught had envied the mouth
      ornament worn by the one hooked earlier in the day, and, stealing it, had
      fixed it in his own jaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bass fishing on the Bay of Quinte is famous for its excellence. Not only
      is there abundance of fish, but they are exceptionally gamey. Their vigour
      and eagerness to be caught is illustrated by the member of this tribe that
      jumped into our boat. Every one has heard of the Florida mullet that,
      attracted by the light in a boat at night, came jumping over the sides in
      such numbers that they sank the boat and imperilled the lives of those on
      board. But a bass is no such fool fish as a mullet. If they do any jumping
      it is usually away from the boat, not towards it. The bass under
      consideration was hooked in some twenty feet of water, and put up a
      vigorous fight. The fisherman was compelled to give out line in
      considerable quantities, but when the fish ran under the boat it was
      evidently time to &ldquo;snub&rdquo; him. No sooner was this done than he gave a leap
      and landed in the boat from the opposite side.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule, ladies are not enthusiastic devotees of the &ldquo;gentle art.&rdquo; One,
      however, whom we knew somewhat well, became, under the tutelage of her
      husband, more than a little expert in fishing for bass. She had grown
      familiar with all their ordinary tricks and knew how to drop the point of
      the rod to prevent an impending leap, and just when to give out line and
      when to reel in. Fishing one day on Round Lake, she hooked a bass and
      proceeded to play it according to the most approved rules. She met every
      rush and anticipated every jump. Then the line became limp and she said to
      her husband, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s off.&rdquo; Just then the fish broke water less than two feet
      away from the boat, flung himself into the air, shook the hook free from
      his jaws, and was gone. Here was one trick with which the fisherwoman was
      not familiar. Small wonder that she asked pathetically, &ldquo;Why did he do
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      One makes strange catches sometimes. We recall a gentleman who, on his
      initial experience in trout fishing, was discovered sitting on a log by
      the stream, examining a strange-looking fish which furnished the solitary
      evidence of his piscatorial skill. &ldquo;Is that a trout?&rdquo; he asked of his
      friend. &ldquo;Hardly,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;What is it, then?&rdquo; That question remains
      unanswered. It was evidently a bottom fish of some kind, and resembled a
      &ldquo;hammer-head,&rdquo; but with some marked differences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one familiar with sea-fishing knows what freaks in form and
      colouring are brought up occasionally when one is fishing for cod or scup
      or flounders. It remained for Mt. Desert to take a safe lead of all
      competitors in furnishing peculiar returns to the fisherman&rsquo;s advances. We
      were fishing off the pier at one of the famous summer resorts of this
      famous island. The fish were not responsive and it was decided to quit.
      When the fisherman attempted to pull in his line he found that his hook
      was snagged. Under a strong but steady pull the line began to come in with
      something heavy dragging at the end. As it made no struggle it could
      hardly be a fish, and sunken logs and sticks are not frequent in
      tide-water. Slowly the catch was drawn in until the wondering fisherman
      could see a jug, brown but not very little, into the handle of which his
      hook had caught. The wonder was that an empty, corked jug should sink.
      When it was discovered that a strong cord anchored the jug to one of the
      timbers of the pier, a suspicion was created that this jug had been caught
      previously. A somewhat hasty and incomplete examination established
      relationship between the jug and the Maine prohibition law, but not
      between the jug and its owner. Can any other fisherman boast of catching
      the &ldquo;spirits of the vasty deep&rdquo;?
    </p>

      Perhaps the Deacon had an experience as exciting, if not as satisfactory,
      as that ever allotted to any fisherman. He and his son and the Preacher
      were fishing on Big St. Germain. The hotel was provided with a porch which
      ran along the entire front. As the party came in from an afternoon with
      the pike, the rods were placed against this porch, butts on the ground and
      tips projecting above the porch roof. The Preacher was the first to finish
      his supper, and as he came out the front door a peculiar combination of
      sounds was heard. Spitting, snarling, scratching were mingled with the
      clicking of a reel. It was the Deacon&rsquo;s reel that seemed to be working
      alone and unaided, and the mystery was solved only when it was discovered
      that a cat had climbed upon the porch roof, swallowed the minnow that the
      Deacon had failed to remove from the hook, and was now making frantic
      efforts to escape. When the Deacon was informed of what was certainly
      nothing short of a cat-astrophe, he hastened to the rescue. Then and there
      was furnished such an exhibition of artistic and skilful handling of a rod
      as few have been permitted to witness. If a ten-pound trout instead of a
      cat had been at the end of the line, the Deacon could not have done
      better. Did the cat run up the side of the building, the Deacon paid out
      line. Did it run down again, he reeled in. His poise and calm were
      admirable. Once, indeed, when the youngster giggled, the Deacon&rsquo;s voice
      was heard remarking that he did not see anything to laugh at. This
      furnished an atom too much for the Preacher&rsquo;s self-control, and he hurried
      into a boat and rowed hastily out to the middle of the lake where he could
      give vent to the emotions which rent and tore him. An hour later, when the
      Preacher returned, all was peaceful. Despite the Deacon&rsquo;s skill&mdash;possibly
      because of it&mdash;the cat had gotten off.

      Did you ever see a muskallonge walk over the water on its tail? It is not
      claimed that this is its favourite method of taking a stroll, but only
      that under certain exceptional circumstances it may be induced to disport
      itself in this manner. W. G. had always felt like fishing, but
      circumstances had not permitted much indulgence of this inherent desire.
      When he had succeeded in making arrangements for a trip to Pike Lake and
      found himself on the twenty-five-mile drive from the railway station to
      the lake, he was happy. To be sure, the city-dweller was not quite
      prepared for the quiet of the woods, and when night came he was heard to
      aver that it was so still it made him nervous. However, on the whole, he
      found the experience quite to his liking, and entered with enthusiasm upon
      pursuit of the valorous muskallonge. It was the first one he struck which
      furnished the remarkable phenomenon of walking upon the water. He was
      trolling with a steel rod and plenty of line out, when a careless muskie
      grabbed the hook. The figure which a moment before had been relaxed and
      seemingly inert, became a mass of steel springs. Over that placid face
      came a look of such fierceness as fairly to frighten his boat-mates. He
      began to reel, but that did not at all satisfy his desire for speed.
      Casting the rod aside, grabbing the line and standing up in the boat, he
      jerked that muskallonge in, seemingly a rod at a jerk. To the onlookers
      the fish seemed to touch only the high places on the water, and then only
      with his tail. Not one muskie out of a thousand has a mouth tough enough
      to stand such treatment, but this was an exceptional fish. He came walking
      into the boat as if he had been accustomed to such violent exercise from
      childhood. We did not need to club him; he had died of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a muskie that furnished us with an introduction to those tricky
      scales which some unregenerate fishermen are said to use. We had journeyed
      to the Ottonaby Lakes, north of Port Hope, in search of bass and
      muskallonge. The senior member of the party had never caught a specimen of
      the latter, and was up at sunrise every morning to be rowed up and down
      until breakfast-time in pursuit of this gallant fish. When the Preacher
      came down to breakfast one morning there was the old gentleman, the centre
      of an admiring group gathered about a muskallonge. There could be no doubt
      as to its genuineness, but when the Senior announced that it weighed
      thirteen pounds, the Preacher was stunned. He thought of certain fish of
      which he had heard whose great weight was found to be due to some pounds
      of shot that had been surreptitiously poured down their gullets. One look
      at the honest face of the Senior dispelled all such suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who weighed him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; answered the landlord. &ldquo;He goes a little over thirteen pounds.&rdquo;
       After breakfast the troubled Preacher went behind the bar in search of
      those scales, and was caught in the act by the landlord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; questioned the proprietor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to weigh that fish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a low voice that could not reach the Senior in the adjoining
      dining-room, the landlord said: &ldquo;Never mind. I&rsquo;ll tell you. That fish
      weighs just five pounds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And that unsuspicious old man went back home and bragged of his
      thirteen-pound muskie, while the Preacher said never a word. What&rsquo;s the
      use of spoiling a good story?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people seem to be naturally skeptical about fish stories. They should
      not be, for tales of piscatorial adventure are peculiar in that, no matter
      how big they are made, they can never equal the facts. The Preacher had
      just come to his new parish, and after a month or so of work there had
      taken a trip to the Nepigon. He could do nothing less, on his return, than
      tell stories of big trout, for there were no others to tell about. At the
      dinner table in one of the homes of his parish he had been relating some
      of his fishing adventures on the famous stream, of an eight-pound trout
      taken at Victoria Pool and the numbers that went four and five pounds
      each, when the hostess, a vivacious and witty woman, threw up her hands
      and jocularly exclaimed: &ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake! What sort of a pastor have we
      drawn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was a year or two later that the Preacher, when spending a few days on
      Tomahawk Lake, caught a muskie that went a little over seventeen pounds.
      Recalling the skepticism of his parishioner, he had the fish packed in a
      box where it could lie out at full length, surrounded it with moss and
      ice, and expressed it to the doubter. When he reached home again the
      skeptic had been soundly converted from the error of her ways. On their
      first meeting after the reception of the muskie, she said: &ldquo;Pastor, after
      this you may tell any fish-lie you like and I will swear to it.&rdquo;
